It is common knowledge among Christians and even non-Christians that Jesus was raised from the dead. But for a believer, Christ's resurrection was not just a mere historical event -_ it is the believer's glorious assurance_.

Paul the Apostle wrote in 1 Corinthians 15:

> But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.
> **1 Corinthians 15:20-22**

Here's what the Lord led me to understand in the Spirit-inspired passages written by Apostle Paul:

### 1. The Feast of Firstfruits points to Christ and His resurrection

Paul wrote that Christ is God's righteousness that is witnessed or testified by the Law and the Prophets (Rom. 3:21). Our Lord Himself said that Moses wrote about Him (John 5:46) and that He came not to abolish the Law but to fulfill it (Matt. 5:17).

One of the feasts which He fulfilled, or more accurately, that points to Him and His resurrection is the Feast of Firstfruits. A firstfruit is a literal harvest and any harvest came or sprouted from the ground. In the case of Christ, He was buried and on the third day He rose again. In Leviticus, it is written:

> He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted on your behalf; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
> **Leviticus 23:11**

How does that point to Christ? First, Christ the firstfruits (1 Cor. 15:23) rose after the Sabbath (Matt. 28:1), on the first day of the week (John 20:1). Secondly, while the literal firstfruits are to be accepted on behalf of the Israelites, God raised Christ from the dead to show that He vindicated or accepted His sacrifice and His resurrection is for the justification of God's people (Rom. 4:25).

### 2. The Extent of Being Alive in Christ

Through Adam sin came into the world and through it death spread to all men (Rom. 5:12). Through Christ's obedience, many are justified and the gift of righteousness abounded to many (Rom. 5:16-17). Paul said,

> For if by the one manâ€™s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness **will reign in life** through the One, Jesus Christ.)
> **Romans 5:17**

Reigning in life is the extent of being made alive in Christ. But that reigning in life is not a life that is free of trouble, or having lots of temporal riches. It does not also mean that we will never die physically. The fullness of reigning in life is not for today but for the future when we'll finally receive our glorified body, when death will finally be swallowed. When there's no more death only we can reign in life through and with Christ. So, Christ's resurrection is not only for our justification and spiritual regeneration but it also assures us of our future glorification.

Soli Deo Gloria!
