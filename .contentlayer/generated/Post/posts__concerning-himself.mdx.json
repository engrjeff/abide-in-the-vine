    "raw": "\nAs a believer of Christ, we are often told to read the Scriptures. Some say we have to read it because it is a “**B**asic **I**nstruction **B**efore **L**eaving **E**arth (Bible)”. Some say that in it we can discover what we have to do throughout the day for different circumstances. Many say it is just a collection of history books with many contradictions amongst each other. People use the passages of the Scriptures to somehow give them some motivational fuel to continue living and to pursue their own dreams. For some, it is simply a manual for life written by men of old.\n\nMany Christians nowadays just open the Book of books in search for guidance for their business, new ventures, whether they should enter through the newly opened door of opportunities, whether they have to get into relationships, and the likes of it. They just turn at the last pages of the Bible and look for the outlined subjects such as healing, wealth, and prayer and then look for relevant passages and upon reading so will make them feel good. While it is undeniable that the Scriptures can be of great help for such things, are those really the essence of the Holy Book? Is it really about us? Is it just a bunch of stories intended for us to be motivated at all times and feel good about ourselves? Are we missing the point, the big picture?\n\nLet us dive into the Scriptures itself and try to understand what it is really all about. In Luke 24:27, it is written:\n\n> “And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things **concerning Himsel**f.”\n\nThe narrative behind that passage is that there were two people talking on the road to Emmaus about the recent events concerning Jesus of Nazareth. While they conversed and reasoned together, the Lord Himself drew near to them. It is quite clear in the passage above that the Scriptures is about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Savior of the world, and the Lord of all. But what does it mean when it is apparent that the people in the Old Testament were not Him?\n\nHere it is. While the events told in the Scriptures do not directly concern Him, all of those point to Him. Let’s dive even deeper and begin at the very first book of the Bible which is Genesis. In Genesis 3:15,\n\n> “And I will put enmity\n> Between you and the woman,\n> And between your seed and her Seed;\n> He shall bruise your head,\n> And you shall bruise His heel.”\n\nAfter the Fall of Man, God said something about “her Seed”. This was the start of the greatest story that is about to unfold through the pages of the Scriptures. The Scriptures is about that Seed. The mind of God is so focused on that “Seed” that He would call men to be players in the scene that He Himself has set into motion. For example in the life of Abraham and Sarah, God called Abraham, promised him that he would have a child from Sarah who was barren that time. The couple had their moments of doubts but God’s promise was fulfilled and Isaac came. Isaac then begat Jacob (Israel) from whom the twelve tribes came out.\n\nLet’s enter the time during the Law and the Prophets._ “Beginning at Moses and all the Prophets”_ implies all of the Old Testament which is the Scriptures itself. From Moses to all the Prophets we can see that the Lord Jesus Christ is concealed beneath many things. The Tabernacle and the Feasts were all about Him. The Law was given through Moses (John 1:17) and the children of Israel tried to obey it by their own strength. But when Jesus taught in the Sermon of the Mount, we have seen that we cannot obey the Law perfectly. The righteousness that God requires is simply unattainable by us. We can see now that we need a better Law keeper. Given the Law, the people of God were still stiff-necked so they asked for Judges to lead them. But it is clear that the Judges who were established by God were simply not enough to keep them from the coming captivity or to tame their wickedness. They had asked then for a king and God somehow allowed their request. So Saul, a tall man, became their king. From Saul to David up to the kings who succeeded them, we see a mix of righteous and wicked men who could not make Israel totally abandon their idols. Until the days of Prophets came when they were oftentimes alone and despised, always in lamentations and great grief over the sins of the chosen nation Israel.\n\nFrom Moses to the Prophets, it is evident that no man is ever enough. No man can tame a wicked heart. But one thing is for sure, the Law (Moses) and the Prophets all point to Christ! Every story and event in the Bible are intricately set in its right time and place with the right role players in order to point us to the Main and Only Hero — the Lord Jesus Christ!\n\n> Every story and event in the Bible are intricately set in its right time and place with the right role players in order to point us to the Main and Only Hero — the Lord Jesus Christ!\n\nJesus Christ is the essence of the Scriptures. We need a better Law keeper, so He kept and fulfilled the Law completely. We need a better sacrifice, so He was the Lamb without blemish righteous enough to atone for the sins of many. He is the propitiation for the sins of the world who was fit to absorb the holy wrath of God. We need a better High Priest, so after His ascension, He has sat down at the right hand of the Father. We need a better Judge, so He came. We need a better King, so He came. We need more than just the Presence in the Tabernacle so He dwelt with us in the flesh (John 1:14). We need more than a prophet so He came. We need a savior, so He came. He was indeed the point of the Law and the Prophets. Philip exclaimed to Nathanael,\n\n> Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “**We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote — Jesus of Nazareth**, the son of Joseph.”\n> **-John 1:45**\n\n> The Lord Jesus Christ is the righteousness of God **being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets** > **-Romans 3:21**.\n\nThe Apostle Paul passionately expounded about the Lord as told in the following text:\n\n> “So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, **persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets**, from morning till evening. ”\n> **-Acts 28:23**\n\nThe Apostle Philip explained to a Eunuch who was reading the book of Prophet Isaiah:\n\n> “Then Philip opened his mouth, **and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him**. ”\n> **-Acts 8:35**\n\nLook at that highlighted portion of the text! The writings of Isaiah points to Christ Himself! It is now compelling to note that the whole Scriptures truly testifies about Christ!\n\nThe whole Gospel of John was written for us to believe in Jesus Christ.\n\n> “but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name. ”\n> **-John 20:31**\n\nThe Book of Acts was about the proclamation of Christ and Him crucified— His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension!\n\nThe Epistles were written to explain Him, not us! The Revelation is about His coming!\n\nBeloved, the Christian life is never about us. Don’t just open the Bible for your sake. While it can really help you in your daily life, I’m afraid that you might miss the point, the grand design which God Himself has orchestrated. Stop treating the Word of God as a mere self-help book for in doing so you are just actually using it as an addition to your life and not your life. Refrain from infusing yourself into the story of the Bible like you’re the hero and the center of the universe. Christ may be preeminent in your life that when you open and read your Bible, your desire will be nothing but “to know Him and Him crucified (1 Cor. 2:2)”. Understand that Jesus Christ is the greater Moses, Joshua, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and David. The central point of the Scriptures is the Son of God to whom we hope and to whose finished works we boast. When you understand in your heart that the whole Bible is never about you but about Him, you will surely dive into it with joy and excitement.\n\nIt is not fitting to say that our lives is about Him and yet we see ourselves as the “entitled” hero of many biblical narratives. Furthermore, you cannot see Christ if you are so filled with yourselves. Many say that they are not saved by works and yet they are always preoccupied with themselves. Ask the Spirit of God who dwells in you that He will empty you of yourself along with your narcissistic desires, that He will help you unlearn things which you have read or heard before, that He will do His illuminating work in your heart as He points you to the Son.\n",
