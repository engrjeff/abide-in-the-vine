    "raw": "\n> The words of the LORD are pure words,\n> Like silver tried in a furnace of earth,\n> Purified seven times.\n>\n> Psalms 12:6\n\nThen word of the LORD are truly pure and this truth teaches us that the LORD is also pure. The LORD is pure and what comes from Him is also pure. _God is light and in Him is no darkness at all (1 John 1:5)_.\n\nNow, what does it mean for the word of God to be pure? Here's what I can find as I survey the Scriptures:\n\n## It means the word of God is trusthworthy\n\nSince the word of the Lord is pure, no blemish or deceit is in it. But notice that in our text, it is liken to a purified silver that was purified seven times. So, God's word is not only pure due to its inherent purity and moral and ethical perfection but also because it passed the test of time. Through fiery trials, the word of God has been proven to be true and steadfast. The Psalmist testified,\n\n> As for God, His way is perfect;\n> The word of the LORD is proven;\n> He is a shield to all who trust in Him.\n>\n> 2 Samuel 22:31\n\nThe word of God in its purity can be trusted. In fact, we express how much we trust God by trusting His word. The word of God is proven and this is why it is absolutely trustworthy. As believers whose only hope is the Lord, we can expect that whatever the Lord has said won't return to Him void but it shall accomplish what He pleases (Isaiah 55:11).\n\n## It means the word of God is enlightening\n\nThe Psalmist wrote,\n\n> The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes;\n>\n> Psalms 19:8b\n\nThe _eyes_ that is being referred here is not the physical eyes of man for if it is, all would have known God. It is the eyes of the heart which the apostle Paul referred to in Ephesians 1:18. The natural man's main malady is not a problem with the optic nerve but a darkened, blinded heart. The heart is where all kinds of darkness sit and only the pure word of God can enlighten it. The enemy continuously blinds the unregenerate man. Paul wrote that for those who are perishing, their minds _\"the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them (2 Corinthians 4:4)\"_. So, what the enemy is trying to prevent is the shining of the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ upon the heart of men. So then, what does it mean to be enlighten by the pure word? It means to have a revelation of who God is in the face of Jesus Christ.\n\n> For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\n>\n> 2 Corinthians 4:6\n\nBut _how_ does God reveal Himself to us these days? It is by knowing the Lord Jesus Christ through the written word. In the pure word of God, He makes Himself known to us. The knowledge of God and His word are inseparable for it is the word of God that tells us who God is.\n\n## It means the word of God is desirable\n\nAs the Psalmist wrote referring to the word of God,\n\n> More to be desired are they than gold,\n> Yea, than much fine gold;\n> Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.\n>\n> Psalms 19:10\n\nEven up to this day, gold is the basis of a nation's economy. Without it, a country has no means of producing money and various resources. This is how valuable it is. Many covet gold and many would go and do unspeakable things just to gain it. Gold symbolizes anything temporary that man pursues and holds dearly in his heart. It is his treasure. But for the one who has indeed \"tasted that the Lord is gracious\" (1 Peter 2:3), to those who are born again, the word of God is more desirable than gold, even than much fine gold.\n\nThe word of God is worthy of all godly desires and affections. The saved person finds delight in it. It is the pursuit of the man of God. It is the precious treasure for which a man of God is so willing to dig for in it are riches that this world can never afford. The man who finds the pure word of God will surely esteem it with the hightest regard and value. The Psalmist gladly exclaimed,\n\n> Your word is very pure;\n> Therefore Your servant loves it.\n>\n> Psalms 119:140\n\nThe cause is the purity of God's word, the resolve or conclusion is a love for it. So, the purity of God's word should not only cause us to salute its moral or ethical perfection but it should also lead us to joyfully desire and love it. The word of God is so much more than a book of rules and stories. Tt is a treasure chest of beauty and all preciousness where the Lord of glory is magnified and revealed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll these things wonderfully expressed who the Lord is. He is the author and the keeper of His word. AS His word is trusthworthy, He is trusthworthy. As He is light, He enlightens us as he reveals Himself to us through the word for it is His pleasure to unveil our eyes in order for us to see Him. His word is desirable for He is desirable. The Lord is the only worthy treasure and it is just a wonderful blessing to savor and pursue Him through His word.\n",
