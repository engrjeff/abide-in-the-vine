    "raw": "\nThe one thing that most people want other people to see is the thing that is most valuable to them. The one that we value the most is that which is most precious to us. It is the treasure of our hearts, our ultimate desire. This is what makes us excited for almost every day. This is what people believe in.\n\nLook at social media. People display priceless moments depicted in lovely photos. People share heartfelt memories. People showcase their business and the products that they sell. People share amazing stories about the goodness in humanity. People post their ideologies, point of views, perspectives and other things which are meaningful and indeed valuable to them. The soon-to-be-married couple parade their prenuptial photos and videos while the newly weds flaunt their sweet moments in their graceful wedding attires along with their ever supportive friends and relatives. Group of friends always boast their fun escapades and refreshing adventures. People also engage in debates and forums to defend what they believe in.\n\nWe have seen now that people have this natural desire to unveil before others what they are fond of the most, what they treasure, and what they believe in. However I can’t help but notice that there is a group of people who is so silent about the very thing that they profess is the most valuable to them — the Christians.\n\nChristians know and hold the very truth in which their salvation from sin is founded. To them was given the revelation about the predetermined plan of salvation from sins. To them was unveiled the very person of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. To them was granted the forgiveness of multitudes of sins. To them was imputed the righteousness of Christ for free — it is free for them while the Lord Jesus Christ suffered for it. They know the most valuable thing on the face of the earth and that is to know the Lord and to follow Him. They know that the only way to the Father is Christ and no religion can provide people salvation. They know the Only Truth that can truly set free a man from all bondages. They know the Author of Life who’s the Only One who can give a man eternal life. They know it all.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ was witnessed by the early Apostles. They had seen and heard Him firsthand. They were witnesses of His death, burial, resurrection and ascension. That’s why after the Holy Spirit had been given to them as written in the Book of Acts, they were so bold in proclaiming that Jesus is Lord and that there is no other name under heaven by which a man can be saved (Acts 4:12). They even had threats from the chief priests and Jewish rulers back then but they were so eager to preach Christ crucified. The Apostle Peter said, “for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard. (Acts 4:20).\" That was the deep desire which consumed them all and compelled them to spread the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ — crying out to the people, on a daily basis, that they should repent, turn from their sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. This is indeed the most important for the early disciples of Christ so they poured out their all to the gospel, to continue in faith no matter what persecutions they might face. This is what drives them. In their hearts, there was always this urgency to go from town to town just to tell all kinds of people the truth!\n\nIs that what the Christians nowadays do and cry out on a daily basis? No! What I see are Christians who are more excited for the latest movies and TV series out there. What I see are Christians who say they believe but denying the power of what they believe in their lives. What I see are Christians who worship with their lips but having a heart that’s far from God. What I see are Christians who are passionate for their businesses or work or studies but have no desire for the word of God. What I see are Christians who wear Christian TShirts thinking that doing so makes them a real one. If Christians believe that the most valuable to have and know is Jesus Christ, shouldn’t they be out there shouting from the house tops this very thing? If they know that the world is getting messier and people are hopeless, shouldn’t they be out there proclaiming that God is a Father to the orphan, the help for the widow, the Provider for the poor, the Hope to the hopeless, the Light in the darkness and the only salvation from sins? I mean, if you know that someone is about to be hit by a big truck, will you just stand and stare or will you come running towards that person and tackle him in order to save him? Many Christians are just professing, they don’t really value what they believe in or should I say do they really believe? Many genuine Christians are dying on a daily basis in many nations because they confessed with boldness that Jesus is Lord in the midst of threats and persecutions. They persevere even they don’t have food and are in jail. Some are even hiding underground. Some don’t have a complete copy of the Bible. Whereas here in my nation where everyone is free to speak out what they believe in and where technology is very much accessible, Christians are still silent.\n\nWhat we believe can be contagious. But how can a fire become a wildfire if it’s not accompanied by heavy rushing wind? The same is true with the Christians. How can the Gospel be proclaimed if the appointed messengers are sleeping? The Apostle Paul got it right\n\n> **Romans 10:13-14**\n> For \"everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?For \"everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?\n\nChristians, stop being a sleeper. Abandon your excuses and live out your holy calling. To you have been entrusted the ministry of reconciliation. You are called an ambassador of Christ. You are not of the world so please stop loving the things in the world that God absolutely despises. You are sent into the world to go to the lost and to tell them the truth. Don’t receive the grace of God in vain. The truth of the gospel is so precious just to be kept in your closet. The world cannot know hope if you won’t speak. Preach the word my Christian friends, preach the word. Preach the word.\n",
