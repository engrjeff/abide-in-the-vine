These things are being fed to us on a daily basis. In this world of self and instant gratification, we see the big role that the media plays. The media shows us what our flesh desires and creates in us a craving for more entertainment — a means which can never get through the depths of the heart. The social media is flooded with contents which aim to inspire, motivate, and push us to be better or to pursue self-advancement. While there is some good in that, we know for sure that such things can still leave us lifeless and unsatisfied. The default of men today is to turn to the world for satisfaction even though they know already that a vanity piled on top of another vanity will just end up in vanity.\r\n\r\n> The default of men today is to turn to the world for satisfaction even though they know already that a vanity piled on top of another vanity will just end up in vanity.\r\n\r\nThere’s one more thing that I believe is more dangerous than turning to the world for satisfaction. This is being self-centered. We live in a time where people want to live autonomously, that is, self-government. Man considers himself as the owner of his life and so resolves to rule it by his own according to his desires. Man considers his faculties including his intellect and emotions to be the only source of reason and that the universe is about himself and that he or she should always be understood by everyone. It is evident these days that men have become lovers of themselves (2 Timothy 3:2) so they create a god in their own mind which is in fact is themselves. They have an image of a god in their mind and heart and yes, that is not the God of the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening now to people also happened to the Israelites of old. The Israelites turned to their own ways and had forsaken the Lord their God who delivered them with great power from Egypt. The Lord, as He told Jeremiah the Prophet, recalls what Israel was once:\r\n\r\n> The word of the LORD came to me, saying,\r\n> “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD,\r\n> “I remember the devotion of your youth,\r\n> your love as a bride,\r\n> how you followed me in the wilderness,\r\n> in a land not sown.\r\n> Israel was holy to the LORD,\r\n> the firstfruits of his harvest…\r\n> **(Jeremiah 2:1–3)**\r\n\r\nIsrael was indeed precious before the Lord. However, the Lord states the unfortunate turning away of His people:\r\n\r\n> 5 Thus says the LORD:\r\n> “What wrong did your fathers find in me\r\n> that they went far from me,\r\n> “What wrong did your fathers find in me\r\n> that they went far from me,\r\n> and went after worthlessness, and became worthless?\r\n> 6 They did not say, Where is the LORD\r\n> who brought us up from the land of Egypt,\r\n> who led us in the wilderness,\r\n> in a land of deserts and pits,\r\n> in a land of drought and deep darkness,\r\n> in a land that none passes through,\r\n> where no man dwells?’\r\n> 7 And I brought you into a plentiful land\r\n> to enjoy its fruits and its good things.\r\n> But when you came in, you defiled my land\r\n> and made my heritage an abomination.\r\n> 8 The priests did not say, ‘Where is the LORD?’\r\n> Those who handle the law did not know me;\r\n> the shepherds transgressed against me;\r\n> the prophets prophesied by Baal\r\n> and went after things that do not profit.\r\n> **(Jeremiah 2:5–8)**\r\n\r\nLet us see what the Israel had done in those days:\r\nThey went far from the Lord to pursue worthless things. They did not remember how the Lord delivered them from Egypt. They defiled the land in which the Lord brought them. The priests who were supposed to be reminding them of the law of God did not know the law themselves. The prophets prophesied falsely by Baal. They went to other things that do not profit. This is the Lord’s summary of what they did:\r\n\r\n> You have played the whore with many lovers\r\n> **(Jeremiah 3:1)**\r\n\r\nThe Israel became so idolatrous that they had utterly forgotten and forsaken the Lord their God. Oh, Christian! can you relate to this? Have you been like the Israel of old? Have you also forsaken the Lord your God? They loved other things more than they loved the Lord.\r\nWe may not be aware of it but we are most oftentimes like the Israelites. We raise our hands in worship every Lord’s day and yet we turn to the passing glory of the world as our nourishment for the rest of the week. The Lord is right when He said:\r\n\r\n> for My people have committed two evils:\r\n> they have forsaken Me,\r\n> the fountain of living waters,\r\n> they have forsaken Me,\r\n> the fountain of living waters,\r\n> and hewn out cisterns for themselves,\r\n> broken cisterns that can hold no water.\r\n> **(Jeremiah 2:13)**\r\n\r\nNote the two evils we have committed:\r\n\r\n1. We have forsaken the Lord;\r\n2. We made for ourselves cisterns which can hold no water.\r\n\r\nWe express through our worship songs that the Lord is the fountain that won’t run dry. But when was the last time we come to Him for a drink of living water? What we always do is that we take the road back to Egypt and drink its bitter waters. We, as Christians, are not ignorant that God is there but we always exercise negligence of Him and in so doing we willfully forsake Him for the sake of the unprofitable things of the world. We love the bitter waters of the world which unknowingly poisons us and drains the life out of us. We forget that life is only found in the Lord and that anything outside of Jesus Christ is a total absurdity. We are not even ashamed that we no longer have the desire to _“taste and see that the Lord is good (Psalm 34:8)”_. When was the last time that we are one with the Psalmist when he said:\r\n\r\n> As a deer pants for flowing streams,\r\n> so pants my soul for You, O God.\r\n> My soul thirsts for God,\r\n> for the living God.\r\n> When shall I come and appear before God?\r\n> **(Psalm 42:1–2)**\r\n\r\nChristian, is there a thirst in you now? Do you long for Him? Is there some craving, longing, and desire for Him somewhere in your heart? Don’t commit the mistake or don’t continue the mistake of thinking that the vanities of this world can ever satisfy that thirst.\r\nWe hewn for ourselves cisterns which can hold no water. We know that a cistern is a large reservoir of water or any liquid. But when it comes to the satisfaction of the weary and thirsty soul, no size of cistern can ever fill it. No matter how large, it will always look broken thus it can never hold a water that satisfies. You see, no matter what things we make as our own means of finding joy — whether it is our hobbies, work, studies, endless TV series, gratification in social media, approval and appraise of men, and even relationships and our church ministries — we will never be joyful with joy that lasts. The reason for this is that it is only that in God’s presence the fullness of joy is found and satisfying pleasures are in Him alone (Psalm 16:11).\r\n\r\nWe oftentimes mock those who built an altar for themselves to put therein a god of their own imagination, crafted by hands. But have we come to realize that we may not have bowed down to idols made with hands but we have surely bowed down to idols made by our hearts? It is not whether we bow to tangible things or not — it is a matter of what really our desire is and where do our affections go. We have gone a long way from the Lord and like the prodigal son we have been wasting our lives playing the harlot and eating with pigs.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we have resolved to turn away from the Lord but there is still hope. We may be bombarded by lots of thoughts of confusion right now since we are lost in the wilderness but there is still hope. We can only hope to God’s sovereign will in order for us to be brought back to His fold. Here’s the Lord’s resolve after He stated His case against Israel:\r\n\r\n> But you have played the harlot with many lovers;\r\n> Yet return to Me,” says the LORD.\r\n> **(Jeremiah 3:1)**\r\n\r\nThe Lord will surely confront us and will tell us that we have sinned against Him. Our sin against Him is so serious that it is not just a silly mistake but a willful rebellion and an offence against Him. He clearly told Israel that they indeed played the harlot and this confrontation must have broken Israel’s heart to pieces. But the Lord, in His sovereignty, chose to respond to their idolatry with tender mercies. The Lord lovingly says, **“Yet return to Me.”**.\r\n\r\nThe same call is being spoken by the Lord to us right now. While we are backsliding, He is constantly calling us to return to Him. “How does He call us?”, one might ask. Well, aside from the sure presence of conviction of the Spirit of God in you right now, He has given you life today. This is God’s call for you:\r\n\r\n> **Return**, O backsliding children,” says the LORD;\r\n> “for I am married to you.\r\n> I will take you,\r\n> one from a city and two from a family,\r\n> and I will bring you to Zion.\r\n> **(Jeremiah 3:14)**\r\n\r\nThe Lord said that He will take us to Himself for He is married to us. We are the church — the Lord’s bride and yet we, in our fragility, still play the harlot. But the Lord’s faithfulness is so great that it does not fail. He still considers Himself married to us. This is indeed a wonderful depiction of God’s love for His people. The call of the Lord is an effectual call that it is the only call that can turn the heart of stone into a heart of flesh. Surely, this loving call from our Good Shepherd will break our hearts that we will repent and acknowledge our iniquity before Him.\r\n\r\nReturn to Him. You may have left the Lord but He has never left you. The prodigal son left his father and wasted his life but when he came to his senses, he decided to go back to his father and when he returned, he found his father with great affection of love and with forgiveness in his eyes running towards him. Return to Him. Return to Him.\r\n\r\nLike the Prophet Jeremiah, may this be our resolve everyday:\r\n\r\n> 22 Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed,\r\n> Because His compassions fail not.\r\n> 23 They are new every morning;\r\n> Because His compassions fail not.\r\n> 23 They are new every morning;\r\n> Great is Your faithfulness.\r\n> 24 “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul,\r\n> “Therefore I hope in Him!”\r\n> **(Lamentations 3:22–24)**\r\n\r\nIn this world, He is our portion which means that He is all we have. Yes, He is all we need but as one preacher always says, He is all we have. Therefore hope in Him alone. Do not trust yourself. As much as you don’t trust yourself for your salvation, don’t also trust yourself or anything else for your satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe Lord is faithful. He saved you, so He will satisfy you. He justified you so He will surely sanctify you. Let us be one with the Apostle Paul in his resolve:\r\n\r\n> And I am sure of this, that He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.\r\n> **(Philippians 1:6)**\r\n",

      "raw": "\n> And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!\n> **1 Corinthians 15:17**\n\nThe resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ is so vital especially for us who believe who, by nature, were \"dead in sins and trespasses (Ephesians 2:1)\". Now, the Apostle Paul made it absolutely clear that if Christ is not risen, our preaching is vain, faith is futile, and we are still in our sins. But why is that? This is because:\n\n> ...faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\n> **Hebrews 11:1**\n\nand without Christ's resurrection, there's really nothing to hope for. Paul wrote in his letter to the Romans, \"_even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body. For we were saved in this hope... (Romans 8:23-24)_\". So, if our Lord Himself did not rise, how can we be sure that our body will be fully redeemed? We have to remember that faith has an object and that must be Christ. True faith is faith in Christ. Faith is not empty only when Christ is risen...and He is, He is alive forevermore!\n\nIn Christ's work we cling and His is the very image to which we will be conformed. Moreover, without His resurrection, we are still in our sins. But why? Because God will only justify the ungodly once His justice is fully satisfied. Now, if Christ is not risen, it must mean that His sacrifice was not enough and therefore not accepted by God, and divine justice was not satisfied. But Christ is risen indeed which means that God vindicated His work by raising Him from the dead. Truly, He \"_was raise because of our justification (Romans 4:25)_\".\n\nSo then, a futile faith is truly empty and leaves a person hopeless and unjustified (still in sins). By faith alone can a man be justified so thanks be to our God for Christ is risen and because of that we are now justified by faith in Him.\n\nSoli Deo Gloria!\n",

      "raw": "\n## Introduction\n\nWe have been told that our faith is _\"the victory that has overcome the world (1 John 5:4)\"_. But what does overcoming the world mean? Surely, as it is apparent in the Scriptures, overcoming the world does not mean being free from sufferings and troubles in life. This world is not our home. We are pilgrims here. _\"They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world (John 17:16)\"_, our Lord Jesus Himself said. The world will do everything in its power to lure us to itself. It continuously offers us pleasures that appeal to the flesh. Being under the influence and control of the enemy, this world's fallen system takes advantage of the nature of the heart - the heart is ever seeking for satisfaction for it is the seat of all our desires. The reason why men jump from one pleasure to another is because it remains restless for God designed the heart in such a way that only Him can fill and satisfy it and bring it to true rest. Augustine once said,\n\n> You have made us for yourself, O Lord,\n> and our hearts are restless until they rest in You\n>\n> -Augustine, _Confessions_\n\nThe world tries to package the enemy's lies in such a way that it is appealing to the eyes and it feeds them into our minds until such things become our desire to the degree that we'll no longer seek the glories of Christ.\n\n## Overcoming The World\n\nSo if overcoming the world is not about being free from sufferings, what does it mean then? It means forsaking the world and everything in it. Every saint has been granted faith by which we overcome the world. This means that every saint is not helpless when it comes to forsaking the world for he or she has faith. We cannot deny the fact that the world has its power and we were once under it and walked according to its course (Ephesians 2:1-2). Thus, to overcome it is indeed a great feat but this can only be achieved by faith. But how? How does this overcoming the world happen? How do we forsake the world by faith? We can address this by looking at an example. Let us see how Moses lived by faith.\n\n## The world-forsaking Faith of Moses\n\nIn the 11th chapter of the rich book of Hebrews where men and women of faith are listed, we see Moses who by faith overcame Egypt.\n\n> By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin...\n>\n> Hebrews 11:24-25\n\nMoses' refusal to be called a son of Pharaoh’s daughter and his choice to rather suffer affliction with the people of God were all rooted in his faith. It is _by faith_ that he was able to do that. He understood that being called a son of Egypt means being given the pleasures of Egypt and _enjoying_ them. As described in the text, the pleasures of Egypt are not godly pleasures but pleasures of sin. Now, we see here that sin indeed has pleasure in it but make no mistake for this pleasure, as described in the text, is _passing_ pleasures. It means that whatever pleasure or joy sin can give or produce in us, it will soon pass away. It is fleeting. It does not last. Moses saw this and realized that staying in Egypt and being a prince there was not worth it. Moses saw by faith that no matter how much pleasure in Egypt he might have, he would soon become empty and seeking again.\n\nMoses saw by faith the reality of passing pleasures of sin but he also saw by faith the greater riches in Christ.\n\n> ...esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward.\n>\n> Hebrews 11:26\n\nEgypt has treasures but Moses saw by faith the greater riches in Christ. Egypt is rich but Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater than that. Through the eyes of faith, Moses realized the surpassing riches of Christ which all the pleasures in Egypt pale in comparison with. In seeing the riches in Christ, Moses was able to forsake the world, that is, Egypt and everything in it. This is how faith overcomes the world. The only way for us to truly leave the world behind is not only by seeing the passing pleasures of sin but also by seeing the surpassing riches of Christ.\n\nThose who are in the world who love the world are blinded (as we were once) for they don't have faith to see (c.f. 2 Cor. 4:4). But the redeemed ones have been granted faith to believe in Christ and to embrace Him as all-satisfying, as joy and the very source of it.\n\n## The Connection of Faith and Desire\n\nWhen we talk about words like \"enjoy\" and \"pleasures\", the word \"desire\" immediately comes to mind. Moses could have just enjoyed what Egypt had to offer and give him but he refused to stay there and chose to rather suffer with the people of God. There we see a shift in desire and the shift happened by faith. Thus, there is a direct connection between a man's faith and his desires.\n\nA man's desire is based on what he embraces as treasure. A treasure is anything that we value the most and that which we cannot afford to lose. So if we desire worldly things, then the world is our treasure. If the world is our treasure then it will be our constant pursuit. Our grip for that which we hold dear is strong because it is rooted in the reality that it is our treasure. But let us not forget that we have been granted faith. It is through this faith that we are saved but it is also like a telescope by which we see the glories of Christ. Moses grew in Egypt but he was able to forsake his upbringing for he saw Him who is invisible:\n\n> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.\n>\n> Hebrews 11:27\n\nMoses esteemed Christ with the highest regard for He saw Him by faith. It is by faith that he was able to see Christ in His glory. So, the nature of the faith that we are given is Christ-seeing and Christ-treasuring and the more we see Christ by faith, the more He will be our desire. Like Moses who saw Christ by faith, we will surely resolve to confess and embrace that indeed, greater riches and treasures are in Him and that He is the only worthy treasure who truly satisfies the heart. So then, esteeming Christ as greater than anything in this world is what enables a man to forsake the world behind him.\n\nA constant looking unto the Lord Jesus Christ is what the Christian life is all about. By faith, we look to the Lord and realize that this world is nothing but broken and void and that the fullness of joy and lasting pleasures are in the Lord alone:\n\n> You will show me the path of life;\n> In Your presence is fullness of joy;\n> At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.\n>\n> Psalms 16:11\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEverytime this world tries to lure us to its passing pleasures, let us remember and believe by faith the surpassing riches of Christ. Seeing the Lord causes a man to forsake the world and this is how our faith overcomes the world. So Like Moses, we ought to keep our eyes on Him who is precious and worthy. Faith is not given to remove all our sufferings (remember Moses?) but that even in our sufferings, we take pleasure in Christ and we delight in Him having Him as our ultimate gain.\n",

      "raw": "\nAs a believer of Christ, we are often told to read the Scriptures. Some say we have to read it because it is a “**B**asic **I**nstruction **B**efore **L**eaving **E**arth (Bible)”. Some say that in it we can discover what we have to do throughout the day for different circumstances. Many say it is just a collection of history books with many contradictions amongst each other. People use the passages of the Scriptures to somehow give them some motivational fuel to continue living and to pursue their own dreams. For some, it is simply a manual for life written by men of old.\n\nMany Christians nowadays just open the Book of books in search for guidance for their business, new ventures, whether they should enter through the newly opened door of opportunities, whether they have to get into relationships, and the likes of it. They just turn at the last pages of the Bible and look for the outlined subjects such as healing, wealth, and prayer and then look for relevant passages and upon reading so will make them feel good. While it is undeniable that the Scriptures can be of great help for such things, are those really the essence of the Holy Book? Is it really about us? Is it just a bunch of stories intended for us to be motivated at all times and feel good about ourselves? Are we missing the point, the big picture?\n\nLet us dive into the Scriptures itself and try to understand what it is really all about. In Luke 24:27, it is written:\n\n> “And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things **concerning Himsel**f.”\n\nThe narrative behind that passage is that there were two people talking on the road to Emmaus about the recent events concerning Jesus of Nazareth. While they conversed and reasoned together, the Lord Himself drew near to them. It is quite clear in the passage above that the Scriptures is about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Savior of the world, and the Lord of all. But what does it mean when it is apparent that the people in the Old Testament were not Him?\n\nHere it is. While the events told in the Scriptures do not directly concern Him, all of those point to Him. Let’s dive even deeper and begin at the very first book of the Bible which is Genesis. In Genesis 3:15,\n\n> “And I will put enmity\n> Between you and the woman,\n> And between your seed and her Seed;\n> He shall bruise your head,\n> And you shall bruise His heel.”\n\nAfter the Fall of Man, God said something about “her Seed”. This was the start of the greatest story that is about to unfold through the pages of the Scriptures. The Scriptures is about that Seed. The mind of God is so focused on that “Seed” that He would call men to be players in the scene that He Himself has set into motion. For example in the life of Abraham and Sarah, God called Abraham, promised him that he would have a child from Sarah who was barren that time. The couple had their moments of doubts but God’s promise was fulfilled and Isaac came. Isaac then begat Jacob (Israel) from whom the twelve tribes came out.\n\nLet’s enter the time during the Law and the Prophets._ “Beginning at Moses and all the Prophets”_ implies all of the Old Testament which is the Scriptures itself. From Moses to all the Prophets we can see that the Lord Jesus Christ is concealed beneath many things. The Tabernacle and the Feasts were all about Him. The Law was given through Moses (John 1:17) and the children of Israel tried to obey it by their own strength. But when Jesus taught in the Sermon of the Mount, we have seen that we cannot obey the Law perfectly. The righteousness that God requires is simply unattainable by us. We can see now that we need a better Law keeper. Given the Law, the people of God were still stiff-necked so they asked for Judges to lead them. But it is clear that the Judges who were established by God were simply not enough to keep them from the coming captivity or to tame their wickedness. They had asked then for a king and God somehow allowed their request. So Saul, a tall man, became their king. From Saul to David up to the kings who succeeded them, we see a mix of righteous and wicked men who could not make Israel totally abandon their idols. Until the days of Prophets came when they were oftentimes alone and despised, always in lamentations and great grief over the sins of the chosen nation Israel.\n\nFrom Moses to the Prophets, it is evident that no man is ever enough. No man can tame a wicked heart. But one thing is for sure, the Law (Moses) and the Prophets all point to Christ! Every story and event in the Bible are intricately set in its right time and place with the right role players in order to point us to the Main and Only Hero — the Lord Jesus Christ!\n\n> Every story and event in the Bible are intricately set in its right time and place with the right role players in order to point us to the Main and Only Hero — the Lord Jesus Christ!\n\nJesus Christ is the essence of the Scriptures. We need a better Law keeper, so He kept and fulfilled the Law completely. We need a better sacrifice, so He was the Lamb without blemish righteous enough to atone for the sins of many. He is the propitiation for the sins of the world who was fit to absorb the holy wrath of God. We need a better High Priest, so after His ascension, He has sat down at the right hand of the Father. We need a better Judge, so He came. We need a better King, so He came. We need more than just the Presence in the Tabernacle so He dwelt with us in the flesh (John 1:14). We need more than a prophet so He came. We need a savior, so He came. He was indeed the point of the Law and the Prophets. Philip exclaimed to Nathanael,\n\n> Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “**We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote — Jesus of Nazareth**, the son of Joseph.”\n> **-John 1:45**\n\n> The Lord Jesus Christ is the righteousness of God **being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets** > **-Romans 3:21**.\n\nThe Apostle Paul passionately expounded about the Lord as told in the following text:\n\n> “So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, **persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets**, from morning till evening. ”\n> **-Acts 28:23**\n\nThe Apostle Philip explained to a Eunuch who was reading the book of Prophet Isaiah:\n\n> “Then Philip opened his mouth, **and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him**. ”\n> **-Acts 8:35**\n\nLook at that highlighted portion of the text! The writings of Isaiah points to Christ Himself! It is now compelling to note that the whole Scriptures truly testifies about Christ!\n\nThe whole Gospel of John was written for us to believe in Jesus Christ.\n\n> “but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name. ”\n> **-John 20:31**\n\nThe Book of Acts was about the proclamation of Christ and Him crucified— His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension!\n\nThe Epistles were written to explain Him, not us! The Revelation is about His coming!\n\nBeloved, the Christian life is never about us. Don’t just open the Bible for your sake. While it can really help you in your daily life, I’m afraid that you might miss the point, the grand design which God Himself has orchestrated. Stop treating the Word of God as a mere self-help book for in doing so you are just actually using it as an addition to your life and not your life. Refrain from infusing yourself into the story of the Bible like you’re the hero and the center of the universe. Christ may be preeminent in your life that when you open and read your Bible, your desire will be nothing but “to know Him and Him crucified (1 Cor. 2:2)”. Understand that Jesus Christ is the greater Moses, Joshua, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and David. The central point of the Scriptures is the Son of God to whom we hope and to whose finished works we boast. When you understand in your heart that the whole Bible is never about you but about Him, you will surely dive into it with joy and excitement.\n\nIt is not fitting to say that our lives is about Him and yet we see ourselves as the “entitled” hero of many biblical narratives. Furthermore, you cannot see Christ if you are so filled with yourselves. Many say that they are not saved by works and yet they are always preoccupied with themselves. Ask the Spirit of God who dwells in you that He will empty you of yourself along with your narcissistic desires, that He will help you unlearn things which you have read or heard before, that He will do His illuminating work in your heart as He points you to the Son.\n",

      "raw": "\n2 Corinthians 4:6\n\n> For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\n> **2 Corinthians 4:6**\n\nWhen God uttered “Let there be light”, the void and the darkness was invaded by the light (Gen. 1:3). Prior to knowing Christ, the heart of a man is like a void and it is in utter darkness. We were “once darkness (Eph. 5:8)”, we were “under the power of darkness (Col. 1:13)”, our hearts were darkened (Rom. 1:21, Eph. 4:18). We “loved darkness rather than the light (John 3:19)” and our deeds were evil.\n\nHow dark was that darkness? As dark as without the light of God or without God Himself (Eph. 2:12). Imagine living even just for a day without the sun and its light. Too dark? Now imagine being without the light of the One who gives and sustains the sun’s light. That’s utter darkness, a great divide. Being in the dark implies many things and that involves being alienated from the life of God (Eph. 4:18). That also involves having sin as our prison, and at the same time our pursuit. Imagine pursuing with passion that which enslaves you. That’s indeed a bondage.\n\nOur hearts were dark enough that it could not perceive the glory of God. So dark that we are compelled to exchange the glory of God to anything that is so much less than Him. This was our depraved state before we heard the gospel of Christ.\n\nBut the Lord is gracious indeed. He knows that man cannot lit a light in his darkened heart. So what we could not and would not do, He did. As He commanded the light out of darkness, He shone Himself in our hearts — yes, not just His light but also Himself. This is what happened in the New Birth. The dead heart which was stone-cold towards God was awakened to the knowledge of God.\n\nA darkened heart corresponds to spiritual deadness and blindness while being enlightened by God means being alive to Him and being able to see and savor Him. God shines in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of His glory in the face of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, God’s greatest revelation is His Son. He is most revealed through His Son. He is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15), the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person (Heb. 1:3). The Lord Jesus Himself said, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father (John 14:9)”.\n\nSince God Himself reveals Himself to us through His Son by the gospel, a person who is truly born again or enlightened or awakened by Him will surely desire Him and will delight in Him. Once he loved darkness but now his heart’s inclination is toward His beautiful Savior and he will surely spend his days knowing Him, making much of Him, and making Him known to those who are still in darkness.\n",

      "raw": "\nKey Text: Job 9:2\n\nThe world is full of mysteries and many questions arise in the human mind concerning a lot of things. But not all questions need a concrete answer. There are questions that just don’t make sense or don’t matter at all. However, there are questions of which the required answer is a matter of life and death, heaven or hell. If such important questions won’t be given a definite answer, a man’s life will hang in a balance and uncertainty will fill his mind and heart, and the unknown will govern his life.\n\nOne such question is found in the Scriptures. It was asked by Job who suffered the loss of all that he had. But it was through his suffering that he was able to ponder upon this question:\n\n> But how can a man be righteous before God?\n> **--Job 9:2**\n\n##### **Repent!?**\n\nJob was prompted to ask that question when one of his friends told him essentially that he should repent. Job had three visiting friends who “made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him (Job 2:11)”. These three friends of Job were Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite.\n\nBildad told Job,\n\n> **If you would earnestly seek God**\n> And make your supplication to the Almighty,\n> **If you were pure and upright**,\n> Surely now He would awake for you,\n> And prosper your rightful dwelling place.\n> **--Job 8:5–6**\n\nMoreover he said,\n\n> Behold, God will not cast away the blameless,\n> Nor will He uphold the evildoers.\n> **--Job 8:20**\n\nBildad’s advise to Job was not bad at all. In fact, he was right. His point was that Job should repent or be made right with God for He deals favorably with the righteous but never upholds the evildoers. However, Job was still perplexed and to his friend he replied:\n\n> Truly I know it is so,\n> **But how can a man be righteous before God?**\n> **--Job 9:2**\n\n##### **Understanding who God is**\n\nJob then continued and talked about the sovereignty of God, His power over all, and that He does great things. Among the things which he said, there are deep things about the nature of God which he realized. The following are so:\n\n> **God will not withdraw His anger**,\n> The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him.\n> How then can I answer Him,\n> And choose my words to reason with Him?\n> For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him;\n> **I would beg mercy of my Judge**.\n> **--Job 9:13–15**\n\nWhat can we learn about God from Job’s realizations? We see here the reality of God’s wrath. _“God will not withdraw His anger”_, Job said. We also see here the reality of God’s justice: _“For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge”_. Job acknowledged that God does not just forget and forgive. His wrath towards sin and the sinners is real and His justice demands that the guilty be punished.\n\nMoreover, there is a striking conclusion that Job uttered. Look at this:\n\n> It is all one thing;\n> Therefore I say, **He destroys the blameless and the wicked**.’\n> **--Job 9:22**\n\nGod destroys the blameless and the wicked. Isn’t it surprising? For sure we are not surprised that the wicked will surely be destroyed. But the blameless? How can Job say that? For Job knew and we ought to know as well that no one is really blameless before God on his own. Job even said about himself:\n\n> I am blameless, yet I do not know myself;\n> I despise my life.\n> **--Job 9:21**\n\nJob said he was blameless while at the same time he didn’t know himself. The point is that like Job, we could be righteous in our own eyes or when we compare ourselves with others. But in reality, “all our righteousness are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6)”. In life, we ought to know two kinds of knowledge: the knowledge of God and the knowledge of self. A right understanding of who God is — His nature, His attributes, His works, and His will will surely make us understand who we are in the most deepest sense. It is when we truly know God that we will be crushed by the reality of our sinfulness and this compels us to cry out for mercy.\n\nNow, knowing who God is and having an understanding that God destroys the self-righteous and the wicked, Job said:\n\n> If I wash myself with snow water,\n> And cleanse my hands with soap,\n> Yet You will plunge me into the pit,\n> And my own clothes will abhor me.\n> **--Job 9:30–31**\n\nJob knew that every effort to cleanse himself will be in vain. No amount of pure water can wash a sinful man clean. No amount of soap can ever whiten a sin-tainted, sin-filled heart. Job also understood that God is holy, that He is not like a man:\n\n> For He is not a man, as I am,\n> That I may answer Him,\n> And that we should go to court together.\n> Nor is there any mediator between us,\n> Who may lay his hand on us both.\n> **--Job 9:32–33**\n\n_“For He is not a man, as I am”_. That statement implies that Job understood that God is indeed transcendent, that He is completely other, that He is totally separate from His creation when it comes to nature, that He is indeed holy. Given these in-depth realizations of Job, he knew that if ever he desires to be right with God, there has to be a mediator between them who may lay his hand on both of them.\n\nSo Job was in utter distress because of his suffering and having realized who God is, guilt and condemnation were added to his agony. In understanding who God is, he also got to know that his greatest malady was not his sufferings but that he could not be right with God on and by his own for he was helpless to save himself.\n\n##### **We have the same malady**\n\nNow, don’t we have the same malady as that of Job’s? The Scripture testifies that no one is righteous, not even one (Rom. 3:10), no one does good (Rom. 3:12), all have sinned and have fallen short of God’s glory (Rom. 3:23), and that the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23), and that the soul who sins shall die (Ezek. 18:4), and that all are guilty before God (Rom. 3:20).\n\nGiven that we have the same malady as Job, we ought to also ask the same question:\n\n> How can I be right with God?\n\n##### **The Remedy to the Malady**\n\nSo, how can a man be right with God? First, let us remember that God is just and His justice should be satisfied, that God is holy and His holiness should never be compromised, that He is wrathful towards the wicked and their sins so His abiding wrath should be removed if any man should be right with Him.\n\nSecondly, we have to understand what it means to be right with God. To be right with Him means, as the Lord Jesus said, “you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect (Matthew 5:48)”. The righteousness that God requires is utter perfection. This righteousness is His own righteousness. He only accepts His own righteousness for any other form of righteousness is just a filthy rag before Him. So then, this righteousness is not found in us but in Him alone. Seeking this righteousness in us or in others is a quest that just ends in vanity — it’s fruitless, lifeless, futile indeed. Thus, only God can give us the righteousness that He Himself requires in order for any man to be right with Him.\n\nAnd now, how can you and I be right God? The answer is in the following passage:\n\n> But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,\n> even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference;\n> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\n> being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed,\n> to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.\n> **--Romans 3:21–26**\n\nSo the answer is found in the person and work of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the very righteousness of God given to man by whom we can be saved. It is through faith in Him, that is, trusting Him for what He did for us, that we can receive this righteousness. But how did this happen? How did Christ’s sacrifice pave the way for our salvation?\n\nHere it is: Christ was put forward by God as a propitiation by His blood. A propitiation is simply a sacrifice that removes wrath. At the cross, Christ became cursed and curse (Gal. 3:13–14), He became sin though He knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21a) because _“the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all\n(Isaiah 53:6)”_. He became an offering for sin (Isaiah 53:10) for He is God’s Righteous Servant who* “shall justify many, For He shall bear their iniquities. (Isaiah 53:11)”*. The Lord Jesus’ sacrifice at the cross satisfied the justice of God, upheld His holiness, and removed His holy wrath. That’s how He secured the salvation of many. God sent His Son to save sinners an He condemned sin in His flesh _“that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us (Romans 8:4)”_. God made Jesus the offering for our sins that we might become His righteousness in Him (2 Cor. 5:21).\n\nNow, let us go back to Job’s problem (and ours as well):\n\n> Nor is there any mediator between us,\n> Who may lay his hand on us both.\n> **--Job 9:33**\n\nGod Himself provided us the Mediator in order for us who are sinners to be reconciled with Him who is holy. Jesus Christ is now the Mediator between God and Man. Paul wrote:\n\n> For there is one God and **one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus**, who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time,\n> **--1 Timothy 2:5–6**\n\nThe Son of God took the form of a bondservant and was obedient up to the point of His death at the cross (Phil. 2:7–8) in order that He might reconcile us to the Father. That’s how He stood in the gap between the holy God and sinful men. Until today, His mediating work continues as He sits at the right hand of the Father in His high priestly office making intercession for us (Rom. 8:34).\n\nThus, our justification, that is, God declaring us righteous before Him, is because of Jesus Christ. We are “justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ”. Christ became our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30) and we are God’s righteousness in Him (2 Cor. 5:21b). We receive this righteousness by faith alone in Christ alone, it is not something that we should attempt to achieve. Having known this truth, we must remember that not our works made us justified in God’s sight — it is only the works of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nAs a conclusion, may we always remember how blessed we are for being made right with God by God through Christ. May we remember how David himself described what it means to be blessed:\n\n> just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works:\n> “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,\n> And whose sins are covered;\n> Blessed is the man to whom the LORD shall not impute sin.”\n> **--Romans 4:6–8**\n\n_All Scripture quotations are in NKJV._\n",

      "raw": "\nIt is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John that the Lord Jesus Christ uses different imageries or word pictures to tell people about who He is. In John 6 we find the Lord claiming to be the Bread of Life (John 6:35). Later in John 8 we find the Lord to be the Light of the world (John 8:12). Before speaking about Him being the Good Shepherd, He spoke of Himself as the Door of the sheep (John 10:7). Then later in verse 11 of the 10th chapter of John’s gospel, we find that the Lord claims to be the Good Shepherd.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ used the imagery of a shepherd during His discourse with the Jews. He used this imagery not only because shepherding is relatable for the Jews for it is a common occupation in Israel but more importantly because God is oftentimes portrayed as the shepherd of His people. God is the Shepherd of Israel and this truth is apparent in the Old Testament writings:\n\n> The LORD is my shepherd;\n> I shall not want.\n> **(Psalms 23:1)**\n\n> Save Your people,\n> And bless Your inheritance;\n> Shepherd them also,\n> And bless Your inheritance;\n> Shepherd them also,\n> And bear them up forever.\n> **(Psalms 28:9)**\n\n> He will feed His flock like a shepherd;\n> He will gather the lambs with His arm,\n> And carry them in His bosom,\n> He will gather the lambs with His arm,\n> And carry them in His bosom,\n> And gently lead those who are with young.\n> **(Isaiah 40:11)**\n\n> For thus says the Lord GOD: “Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out. As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day.\"\n> **(Ezekiel 34:11–12)**\n\nNow, we see the Lord Jesus Christ speaking of Himself as the Good Shepherd.\n\n> **I am the good shepherd**. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.\n> **(John 10:11)**\n\nEssentially, the Lord Jesus Christ is saying that He is God. He is the God-Man. He is truly Man and truly God. He is not 50% Man and 50% God. He is both 100% Man and 100% God at the same time. He is the same God who spoke to Moses at the burning bush in Exodus 3. He is the one who said to Moses,\n“I AM WHO I AM…Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you. (Exodus 3:14)”.\n\n##### **The False Shepherds**\n\nJesus is contrasting Himself with the Jewish leaders whom He describes as thieves and robbers (John 10:1) and strangers (John 10:5). The Jewish leaders are the false shepherds during the time of Jesus. They bring with them the Mosaic Law mixed with their man-made traditions and doctrines thereby creating a false religion that serves as a heavy yoke for the Israelites. In Ezekiel 34, there’s a prophecy concerning the false shepherds of Israel:\n\n> And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD to the shepherds: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool; you slaughter the fatlings, but you do not feed the flock. The weak you have not strengthened, nor have you healed those who were sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back what was driven away, nor sought what was lost; but with force and cruelty you have ruled them. So, they were scattered because there was no shepherd; and they became food for all the beasts of the field when they were scattered. My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill; yes, My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and no one was seeking or searching for them.”\n> **(Ezekiel 34:1–6)**\n\nThe false shepherds are the irresponsible, self-centered, religionist, legalist, and traditionist leaders of Israel. The Lord is against such leaders.\n\n##### **Jesus Christ: The Good Shepherd**\n\nJesus Christ is the Good Shepherd of His own sheep. He is the One who was moved with compassion for the multitudes who were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd (Matt. 9:36). He is the one whose yoke is easy and whose burden is light from whom we can find rest (Matt. 11:28). He is the fulfillment of the prophecy in Ezekiel 34:\n\n> For thus says the Lord GOD: “Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out. As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day.\n> **(Ezekiel 34:11–12)**\n\nHe fulfilled this prophecy by becoming the incarnate Son of God who came here on earth “to seek and save that which was lost (Luke 19:10)”. He is the Good Shepherd who truly cares for His own sheep.\n\nNow, what does it mean for the Lord Jesus Christ to be the Good Shepherd? When we hear the sentence “the LORD is my Shepherd”, the famous Psalm 23 immediately comes to mind. Because of this, we think of comfort in Christ, how He cares for us, how He leads us. Those things are indeed true and worth-knowing. But there’s so much more to Christ being the Good Shepherd.\n\n##### **The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the Sheep**\n\n> I am the good shepherd. **The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep**…\n> **(John 10:11)**\n\nThe Lord Himself defines what it means for Him to be the Good Shepherd. It is plainly told by the Lord that the Good Shepherd gives His life for the sheep. Unlike a hireling who does not own the sheep and therefore has no care for the sheep, the Good Shepherd does not leave the sheep and does not flee for His own life. The good shepherd does not flee for His own life but rather gives His own life for the sheep. He is the _Shepherd Savior_:\n\n> Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd,\n> Against the Man who is My Companion,”\n> Says the LORD of hosts.\n> “Strike the Shepherd,\n> And the sheep will be scattered;\n> Then I will turn My hand against the little ones.\n> **(Zechariah 13:7)**\n\n> Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written:\n> I will strike the Shepherd,\n> And the sheep of the flock will be scattered.\"\n> **(Matthew 26:31)**\n\nChrist became the front liner. He was the one stricken while being left alone. While we are like sheep who have gone astray and turned to our own way, the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Isaiah 53:6). He took upon Himself the full weight of the sheep’s sins thus receiving the full weight of God’s holy wrath upon Himself at the cross. For this purpose, He came: “to give His life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28)”.\n\nThis is a deep demonstration of His love for His own sheep. Indeed, there is no greater love than what the Good Shepherd has demonstrated to us:\n\n> Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.\n> **(John 15:13)**\n\nAnd this is how we know what love really is:\n\n> By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\n> **(1 John 3:16)**\n\nHere we can see that the Lord’s love for His own sheep goes beyond His willingness to bless us with what we need. It is far-reaching that what He gave us is His own life — the life that had been lived in perfection. The Good Shepherd is good not only because He sought us but also because He saved us by dying on the cross for us.\n\n##### **The Good Shepherd knows His Own**\n\n> I am the good shepherd; and **I know My sheep**, and am known by My own.\n> **(John 10:14)**\n\nThe Good Shepherd knows His very own. He knows His own not only in the cognitive sense but also in the saving (salvific) sense. He knows them not because they lived in the past, living in the present, or will live in the future. He knows them because they are chosen in Him before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). He knows His own that He knows whom He must bring out of the fold of false religions and world systems. He knows His own that He is so certain who to seek in the wilderness. He knows His own so much that He can identify if someone is lost. His knowledge of His own is so important because these are the ones for whom He must die.\n\nThe Good Shepherd did not seek for random people. He sought for specific sheep which are His very own. Jesus Himself said that He came to “give His life as a ransom for many. (Matt. 20:28)”. The word “many” doesn’t imply “all”. The word “many” means a certain elect group of people and for this group alone He died. This group is collectively known as the “sheep” in this context.\n\nThe sheep are the ones whom the Father gives to Christ (John 6:37). These people will surely come to Christ because the Father will draw them to Him (John 6:44). The Lord Jesus Christ knows His own that when His sheep are gathered together with the goats, He knows how to divide the sheep from the goats (Matt. 25:32).\n\n##### **The Good Shepherd is known by His Own**\n\n> I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and **am known by My own**.\n> **(John 10:14)**\n\nThe sheep might be temporarily lost but they will surely be found by the Shepherd. By the effectual call of the Good Shepherd, they will surely respond for they know His voice. The sheep know their Shepherd’s voice because only Him knows their name and calls them by it (John 10:27). The sheep of the Lord Jesus Christ know His voice because His voice is unique and distinct from the stranger’s voice. When the Shepherd calls, only the sheep will respond because they are the only ones who are made able and willing to respond to that call.\n\nTo be known by the Lord and to be given the great privilege of knowing Him is such a great blessing indeed! The sheep then must be grateful that the Lord Jesus Christ, on the last day, will not tell them, “I never knew you” but will joyfully receive them to glory.\n\n##### **Conclusion**\n\nThe Good Shepherd is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the one who calls His own and is followed by His own. He willingly gave His life for His own sheep alone. He knows His own and is known by His own for to them He chose to reveal Himself.\n",

      "raw": "\nThe hour has come and the Lord Jesus Christ was about to be betrayed with a traitor’s kiss to be delivered to wicked men. It was that time that the Feast of the Passover was at hand so He and His disciples went to an upper room. There the Lord instituted the Lord’s Supper. There He ate with them. There He washed the disciples’ feet. There He gave them a new commandment to love one another. But there was also the place where His betrayer, Judas Iscariot, lifted up his heel against Him (John 13:18). It was after the traitor had left that Jesus spoke the following words:\n\n> Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come,’ so now I say to you.\n> **(John 13:33)**\n\nThis must be saddening for the disciples. Having been with the Lord during His earthly ministry, the Lord knew that they would be exceedingly troubled and their hearts would be filled with grief at the thought of His departure. But the Lord spoke to them words of assurance and comfort:\n\n> Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. And where I go you know, and the way you know.\n> **(John 14:1–4)**\n\nSorrow might fill their hearts but the Lord Jesus Christ spoke words of comfort to them. The Lord’s words are comforting because they gave the disciples solid hope on which they could really rely. The Lord’s words are marked with utmost sincerity, faithfulness, assurance, and love.\n\nNow, the Lord made it clear that He would go to the Father but somehow Thomas, or even perhaps most of them, was bewildered. He was confused that he asked the Lord, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way? (John 14:5)”. It was at this moment when the Lord uttered one of the most popular statements concerning Himself:\n\n> I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.\n> **(John 14:6)**\n\n##### **Jesus is the Way**\n\nThomas said that they did not know where the Lord was going and the way to get there. So Jesus said that He is the way and no one comes to the Father except through Him. Now, what does it mean for Jesus to be the way to the Father?\n\n**The way to be with the Father.** The most popular meaning is that He is indeed the way to heaven. He is the road or the pathway through which people must come in order to get to the Father. The Lord Jesus Christ is not a way, He is the way and any other way is no way at all. This truth about Christ is a hard blow to the philosophical notion of pluralism. Pluralism asserts that every religion is valid and everything can be regarded as truth. By that assertion alone, pluralism tries to put an end to truth by accepting all to be true. But in the Christian faith, Christ alone is the way to heaven. Christ alone is the means to get to the Father to be with Him forever.\n\nThe evangelical world today is infested with many ideas which contradict the biblical doctrine of Christ being the only way to heaven. Some professing Christian ministers deny this truth in an attempt to promote unity among the diverse religions but compromising what Jesus said about Himself for the sake of unity is a total negligence of truth. Jesus Christ is the narrow gate (Matthew 7:13) and without Him, no one can come to the Father and every one will be damned in hell for all eternity.\n\n**The way to know and see the Father.** The Lord Jesus followed His statement with this:\n\n> If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.\n> **(John 14:7)**\n\nBut Philip replied,\n\n> Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.”\n> **(John 14:8)**\n\nTo which the Lord replied,\n\n> Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?\n> **(John 14:9)**\n\nThe way to know the Father is knowing the Lord Jesus Christ. The way to see the Father is to behold the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is the ultimate revelation of the Father. He is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15), the brightness of the Father’s glory, and the express image of His person (Heb. 1:3). The glory that has been withheld to the Old Testament people such as Moses (Exo. 33:18, 20) was revealed through the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, it is quite fascinating to know that Christ is not only the way to heaven, He is also the way for us to know and see the Father. In fact, heaven itself is just a consolation prize, the knowledge of God Himself is the greatest reward for the elect of God.\n\n##### **Jesus is the Truth**\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is the very embodiment of truth. He is absolute truth. No lie can come forth from Him. This also proves His deity for God cannot lie (Titus 1:2) and since Jesus is truth, He is God. He is also the very source of truth. Every lie is a departure from the truth. So, if you want to live according to the truth, you must know Christ and abide in His teachings. He is the absolute aid to all sorts of confusion and deception caused by the devil.\n\n##### **Jesus is the Life**\n\nChrist not only gives and sustains life, He is life Himself. From His being springs life. In Him is life — not only biological life but also eternal life or the God-kind of life. There is no life outside of the Lord Jesus Christ. When we understand that Christ is life, we would surely stay with Him for the thought of being without Him must be horrifying. He is the essence of life and His elect are blessed indeed to be given the life that is in Him alone.\n",

Christ alone is the means to get to the Father to be with Him forever.\"]},void 0,!0,{fileName:\"C:\\\\EngrJeff\\\\Engr Jeff\\\\2022 projects\\\\abide-site\\\\frontend\\\\content\\\\posts\\\\_mdx_bundler_entry_point-98db346e-05ac-4a62-9c77-29a79b61e68a.mdx\",lineNumber:32,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,o.jsxDEV)(r.p,{children:\"The evangelical world today is infested with many ideas which contradict the biblical doctrine of Christ being the only way to heaven.

      "raw": "\nLet me begin this post by reminding all of you that everything that is written in the Scriptures is truth. The biblical writers were not writing mere observations or just their own speculations. What they wrote is true and is indeed truth. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God (2 Timothy 3:16). Since God is truth and that He cannot lie, everything that is in His written word is truth.\n\nThe words of the Scriptures are tested and proven to be true. They have passed the test of time. They have brought even the most intellectual critics to their knees. They have even put to shame many skeptics which paved the way for them to turn to the Lord. Countless prophecies have already come to pass and many more are yet to unfold. Thus, there is no other book which can perfectly assess man except the holy Scriptures. Not only is the complete and perfect plan of God’s redemption through His Son is written in the Bible. It also includes the condition of man along with his nature, desires, pursuits, and end.\n\nEverything that man needs to know with regards to his soul is in the Scriptures. Today, we will let the word of God bring us into a state of self-examination not for the purpose of bringing condemnation upon ourselves but to see what we really need. Only the word of God can expose us for who and what we truly are and God does this always for our good and ultimately for His own glory. May the Spirit of truth bring us face to face to the word of God and as we become exposed before God, may we be convicted to throw ourselves upon His mercy and grace.\n\n##### **All is Vanity**\n\nThe Scripture is filled with many truths which may appear untrue to the carnal mind. Even some believers are having a hard time believing what’s written there. Nevertheless, God’s word is true no matter what we feel, think, or believe. No matter how much we reason against God, the final verdict is from God and His verdict is that whatever is in His word, it is truth.\n\nOne of the most painful assertions in the Scriptures is written by the wisest man (aside from the Lord Jesus Christ) who ever walked on the face of the earth — King Solomon, the son of David with Bathsheba (2 Sam. 12:24). Under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, he wrote most of the book of Proverbs, Songs of Songs, and Ecclesiastes. Solomon was young when he became king and having understood his limitation that time, he asked the Lord that He would give him wisdom and He did.\n\nIn the Book of Ecclesiastes, King Solomon wrote:\n\n> “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher;\n> “Vanity of vanities,**all is vanity**.”\n> What profit has a man from all his labor\n> In which he toils under the sun?\n> **Ecclesiastes 1:2–3**\n\nIs everything really vain? Is there really no profit in everything that we do under sun? Of course not! All is vanity not in the sense that everything is futile or that everything that we do has no value. Not everything is worthless for there are things that have value — but only _temporal_ value. Your studies, jobs, businesses, and other endeavors have temporal value. These things are not worthless. In fact, God is glorified when you do these things for His glory. But if we are going to look to things through the lens of the spiritual, everything indeed is vanity. All is vanity because “That which has been is what will be, That which is done is what will be done, And there is nothing new under the sun (Ecclesiastes 1:9)”. Events are recurring. History is repeated. There is nothing new under the sun.\n\n##### **Look Behind**\n\nSolomon wrote,\n\n> Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them.\n> I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,\n> For my heart rejoiced in all my labor;\n> And this was my reward from all my labor.\n> **Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done**\n> And on the labor in which I had toiled;\n> And indeed all was vanity and grasping for the wind.\n> There was no profit under the sun.\n> **Ecclesiastes 2:10–11**\n\nOne definition of the word “vanity” is an _“excessive pride in or admiration of one’s own appearance or achievements”_. This is why for Solomon, all his labor was in vain. Not because his labor did not produce good results but because he took pride in all his labor. He said, “For my heart **_rejoiced in all my labor_**; And **_this was my reward_** from all my labor”. There is a form of joy that he got from what he accomplished and that became the reward or in other words, the satisfaction of his heart. But then, Solomon was really wise for when he looked back to all that his hands had made, he saw the emptiness, the void, the unprofitability, and the futility of it all and his conclusion was “indeed all was vanity and grasping for the wind.” All was vanity for Solomon because he made his labors the ultimate source of his joy and satisfaction. The mindset that what you do, that is, your performance will ever satisfy you is a symptom of a prideful heart. It is in essence thinking that what you do **MUST** be about you and ultimately **FOR** you. In short, that is self-dependence, self-trust, self-sufficiency, self-righteousness, and self-centeredness. And as long as we regard other things and even what we do and ourselves as the well from which our joy springs, all is vanity.\n\nThe wise king likened the vanity of everything to grasping the wind. Try to grasp the wind. Did you catch a portion of it? Did the wind stay in your hand? I am sure that it didn’t. And yet that’s what we do, right? We follow hard after the things of this world even though we already know that nothing in this world can satisfy our souls. God intended that the creation be for man’s enjoyment and supplication. The things which are external to man and even the things that man can produce are not intended to be the source of his joy and satisfaction. God literally walked with our first parents in the Garden of Eden and I must speculate that God was their joy and God was most glorified in them for they were most satisfied in Him. Until the Fall of man happened.\n\nOne of the results of man’s radical fallenness is that his disposition was changed from something that delights in God to something that is rebellious against Him. Man’s heart is no longer captivated by God’s glory. That’s why the Bible says, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)”. Man’s heart became so stone cold towards God but it desires sin and the poisonous effects that it brings. We lack the regard for God’s glory, that is what falling short of God’s glory means. Thus, although we knew God, we did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in our thoughts, and our foolish hearts were darkened (Rom. 1:21). Instead of pursuing the Creator, we pursued the things of the world. The external things which are not meant to satisfy our souls are now the things that enslave us and at the same time the things that we pursue.\n\nWe live in a time where there are lots of things around us that are designed in order to attempt to satisfy the needs of men. These things are being fed to us on a daily basis. In this world of self and instant gratification, we see the big role that the media plays. The media shows us what our flesh desires and creates in us a craving for more entertainment — a means which can never get through the depths of the heart. The social media is flooded with contents which aim to inspire, motivate, and push us to be better or to pursue self-advancement. While there is some good in that, we know for sure that such things can still leave us lifeless and unsatisfied. The default of men today is to turn to the world for satisfaction even though they know already that a vanity piled on top of another vanity will just end up in vanity.\n\nHaving known these things, let us go back to Solomon’s conclusion:\n\n> **Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done**\n> And on the labor in which I had toiled;\n> And indeed **all was vanity and grasping for the wind.**\n> There was no profit under the sun.\n> **Ecclesiastes 2:11**\n\nI want you to look back on the things that you’ve said and done in the past years, months, weeks, or even days. Now, can you honestly tell that most of your time were spent glorifying God, seeking Him, pursuing Him, following Him? When was the last time you drink a glass of water for His glory? When was the last time that you did not let a day skip without reading His word? When was the last time you slipped away from the noise of this world to get alone with God in worship and prayer? When was the last time that the Lord is the desire of your hearts? Were the things you said and done pleasing to God? Can you say that the way you lived your life prior to this day was worth it?\n\nThe Bible teaches us,\n\n> **Do not love the world or the things in the world**. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\n> For all that is in the world — the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life — is not of the Father but is of the world.\n> And **the world is passing away**, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.\n> **1 John 2:15–17**\n\nIf most of your answers to the diagnostic questions above are negative, then you really have to admit that God is no longer your joy. You have to humbly admit with all honesty that you need to repent and to turn to God. The Bible teaches that we should not love the world or the things of the world. We had once walked in the pattern of this world, we had once gratified ourselves with the pleasures of this world, we had once boast in ourselves and in what we did. Now it is time to abandon all those things because the world is passing away and everything in it. That is what Solomon is talking about — that the end of everything in this world is vanity.\n\nBut we have to admit that it is hard to let go of the things which we once held dear to us. We had attachments to the temporal and the material which made us detached from the spiritual, from the things of God and from God Himself. We had habits which don’t bring glory to God. We had sins that we love. We had become self-centered that we have forgotten that our lives should be about God and for God. But I truly believe that if we understand that Christ is the only one who is all-satisfying and that in Him is the fullness of joy, we will surely leave every vanity that is in the world.\n\n##### **Look to Christ: Joy in Christ and Christ as joy**\n\nYou see, no matter what things we make as our own means of finding joy — whether it is our hobbies, work, studies, endless TV series, gratification in social media, approval and appraise of men, and even relationships and our church ministries — we will never be joyful with joy that lasts. The reason for this is that it is only that in God’s presence the fullness of joy is found and satisfying pleasures are in Him alone (Psalm 16:11).\n\nWe express through our worship songs that the Lord is the fountain that won’t run dry. But when was the last time we come to Him for a drink of living water? What we always do is that we take the road back to Egypt and drink its bitter waters. We, as Christians, are not ignorant that God is there but we always exercise negligence of Him and in so doing we willfully forsake Him for the sake of the unprofitable things of the world. We love the bitter waters of the world which unknowingly poisons us and drains the life out of us. We forget that life is only found in the Lord and that anything outside of Jesus Christ is a total absurdity. We are not even ashamed that we no longer have the desire to “taste and see that the Lord is good (Psalm 34:8)”. When was the last time that we are one with the Psalmist when he said:\n\n> “As a deer pants for flowing streams,\n> so pants my soul for You, O God.\n> **My soul thirsts for God,\n> for the living God.**\n> When shall I come and appear before God?”\n> **Psalm 42:1–2**\n\nNow I am calling you to come to Jesus and see Him as the all-satisfying one, the never-ending joy for our hearts. The joy that is found in Him alone is the only joy that can make our hearts like a well-watered garden. Consider the Apostle Paul with his credentials:\n\n> If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so:\n> circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.\n> **Philippians 3:4–6**\n\nJust like Solomon, Paul had his labors. He once boasted what he was and his confidence in his flesh produced in him a false zeal that led to the persecution of many early believers. But for Paul, it wasn’t too late. He wrote to Timothy,\n\n> And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; **but I obtained mercy** because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.\n> **1 Timothy 1:12–13**\n\nPaul obtained mercy from God and He was saved by the grace of God. His encountered with Christ changed him in a dramatic way that he became passionate to spread the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Having known Christ and having saved by Him, this is his amazing resolve:\n\n> **But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ**.\n> Yet indeed** I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord**, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ\n> **Philippians 3:7–8**\n\nPaul was able to count all things as loss because he knew to whom he should be running. He knew what his life should be about. He knew that Christ is His ultimate gain. He knew that Christ alone can bring him satisfaction. When he encountered Christ, his confidence in himself was gone. His pride that once stood high was knocked down. His disposition was changed. When he met Christ in all of His beauty and glory, his emptiness surfaced and that made him want Christ more. Indeed, all things were vanity for Paul and he counted them as loss for the sake of having his all-satisfying Savior. For Paul, nothing is more supreme or excellent than the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. Indeed, he understood the true essence of eternal life — to know God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent (John 17:3).\n\nWe know that Christ important. But do we know that He is the most important? May our resolve be like that of the Apostle Paul’s. May Christ reign supreme in our heart so that we will no longer run after the things of this world. Life is in Christ alone and He Himself is the Life. Real and lasting joy is found in Him alone and only Him must be our satisfaction.\n\nNow, I am calling you not only to look behind you but more importantly to forget what is behind and to look forward to what lies ahead. Just like what Paul said,\n\n> Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, **forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead**,\n> **Philippians 3:13**\n\nYou cannot do anything about your past. The world will not change anytime soon. The evil and the vanity in this world will grow worse. But understand that we are pilgrims here. This world is not our home so let your eyes be stamped with eternity as you run this race:\n\n> …let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,** looking unto Jesus**, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n> **Hebrews 12:1–2**\n\nWhen being drawn into the world, when the world is trying to lure you into its vain pleasures, just remember that you are not of this world, you are already in Christ. Thus,\n\n> If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. For you died, **and your life is hidden with Christ in God.\n> Colossians 3:1–3**\n\nThe only life that is worth living is the life lived for Christ. In the world is vanity, but in Christ our end is glory.\n",

A spiritually dead person is carnally-minded. His mind is not subject to God's Law, indeed it cannot (Romans 8:7). Thus, to be able to love the pure word of God requires a supernatural work of God Himself.\n\nThe Lord did wonderful things for us and in us. But such wondrous works are not an end. Rather those are means in order for us to love Him and His word, that is, to make much of Him. He didn't save to teach us to be self-centered but to look away from ourselves and to Him. A truly saved person can see the purity of God's word and resolves to love it. Indeed, it is an amazing work of God to change a man from being a rebel to a man who lovingly delights in Him.\n\nHow about you, do you love the pure word of God?\n",

      "raw": "\nIt is common knowledge among Christians and even non-Christians that Jesus was raised from the dead. But for a believer, Christ's resurrection was not just a mere historical event -_ it is the believer's glorious assurance_.\n\nPaul the Apostle wrote in 1 Corinthians 15:\n\n> But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.\n> **1 Corinthians 15:20-22**\n\nHere's what the Lord led me to understand in the Spirit-inspired passages written by Apostle Paul:\n\n### 1. The Feast of Firstfruits points to Christ and His resurrection\n\nPaul wrote that Christ is God's righteousness that is witnessed or testified by the Law and the Prophets (Rom. 3:21). Our Lord Himself said that Moses wrote about Him (John 5:46) and that He came not to abolish the Law but to fulfill it (Matt. 5:17).\n\nOne of the feasts which He fulfilled, or more accurately, that points to Him and His resurrection is the Feast of Firstfruits. A firstfruit is a literal harvest and any harvest came or sprouted from the ground. In the case of Christ, He was buried and on the third day He rose again. In Leviticus, it is written:\n\n> He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted on your behalf; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.\n> **Leviticus 23:11**\n\nHow does that point to Christ? First, Christ the firstfruits (1 Cor. 15:23) rose after the Sabbath (Matt. 28:1), on the first day of the week (John 20:1). Secondly, while the literal firstfruits are to be accepted on behalf of the Israelites, God raised Christ from the dead to show that He vindicated or accepted His sacrifice and His resurrection is for the justification of God's people (Rom. 4:25).\n\n### 2. The Extent of Being Alive in Christ\n\nThrough Adam sin came into the world and through it death spread to all men (Rom. 5:12). Through Christ's obedience, many are justified and the gift of righteousness abounded to many (Rom. 5:16-17). Paul said,\n\n> For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness **will reign in life** through the One, Jesus Christ.)\n> **Romans 5:17**\n\nReigning in life is the extent of being made alive in Christ. But that reigning in life is not a life that is free of trouble, or having lots of temporal riches. It does not also mean that we will never die physically. The fullness of reigning in life is not for today but for the future when we'll finally receive our glorified body, when death will finally be swallowed. When there's no more death only we can reign in life through and with Christ. So, Christ's resurrection is not only for our justification and spiritual regeneration but it also assures us of our future glorification.\n\nSoli Deo Gloria!\n",

It is not my goal to give you mere information about what patience means but rather, it is my intention to help you behold our patient God.\r\n\r\n## Our God is the God of patience\r\n\r\n> now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus.\r\n> **-Romans 15:5 NKJV**\r\n\r\nOur God is the God of patience. It means that from His being flows patience. It is not from something external to Him just like any of His attributes or excellencies. Now, God is patient not because He is _soft_. His patience is never an indication of His softness or His tolerance of sin and the sinner. God is kind. He is truly good but He is not soft. God accepts a sinner by His grace but He never tolerates their sins.\r\n\r\n### God is longsuffering\r\n\r\nGod is patient towards the sinners not because He has no other choice on how to deal with them but because He is rich in mercy.\r\n\r\n> The LORD is longsuggering and abundant in mercy...\r\n> **Numbers 14:18 NKJV**\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist proclaimed:\r\n\r\n> But You, o LORD, are a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in mercy and truth.  \r\n> **Psalms 86:15 NKJV**\r\n\r\n## God is so patient with you and me\r\n\r\nLike the Israelites of old whom God delivered from the bond of slavery and from Egypt itself, we tend to forget God and what He has done for us. Instead of pursuing Him being motivated by His unfailing love and unceasing faithfulness, we oftentimes choose to run away and drink the bitter waters of the world. Here's God's _cry_ as spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah:\r\n\r\n> 5 Thus says the Lord:\r\n> “What injustice have your fathers found in Me,\r\n> That they have gone far from Me,\r\n> Have followed idols,\r\n> And have become idolaters?\r\n> 6 Neither did they say, ‘Where is the Lord,\r\n> Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,\r\n> Who led us through the wilderness,\r\n> Through a land of deserts and pits,\r\n> Through a land of drought and the shadow of death,\r\n> Through a land that no one crossed\r\n> And where no one dwelt?’\r\n> 7 I brought you into a bountiful country,\r\n> To eat its fruit and its goodness.\r\n> But when you entered, you defiled My land\r\n> And made My heritage an abomination.\r\n> 8 The priests did not say, ‘Where is the Lord?’\r\n> And those who handle the law did not know Me;\r\n> The rulers also transgressed against Me;\r\n> The prophets prophesied by Baal,\r\n> And walked after things that do not profit. -**Jeremiah 2:5-8 NKJV**\r\n\r\nImagine God, the One who created all things and have put us therein to enjoy His blessings, the One who gave us life, saying, _\"What injustice have your fathers found in Me, That they have gone far from Me?\"_. Imagine that He who is most worthy of all honor and praise, who deserves all our attention, who is supposed to be our heart's treasure, to whom all our affections must go, was dethroned from our hearts for the sake of following dumb and unprofitable idols. Imagine Him who offers us life yet we neglect Him for things that are infinitely so much lesser than Him. Oh, how small-minded are we that we have exchanged the glory of the Creator for the passing glory of the creature. We feed our heart and mind with worthless things and utterly turned our back from the Lord's table on which we could have a feast in His presence. Oh, how small minded are we!\r\n\r\nBut here's what is wonderful as I read through Jeremiah's book: that inspite of what His people like us did, the heart of God towards His people is this:\r\n\r\n> But you have played the harlot with many lovers;\r\n> **Yet return to Me**,” says the Lord. -**Jeremiah 3:1 NKJV**\r\n\r\nThe One against whom we have sinned greatly is also the One calling us to Himself. Again, it is not because He tolerates our sinfulness but because He is patient and rich in mercy. It is out of pure love. The LORD Himself declares:\r\n\r\n> The Lord has appeared of old to me, saying:\r\n> 'Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love;\r\n> Therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you.' -**Jeremiah 31:3 NKJV**\r\n\r\n## God's Glorious Purpose in Being Patient\r\n\r\nNow you might think that God is unrighteous or unjust because He didn't punish the sins of His people in the past. He forgave Abraham when he lied, He restored David when he committed the grave sin of murder and adultery. As a just Judge, God should have punished their sins since Christ hadn't yet died on the cross. Now to be enlightened with this _issue_ let us consult what the Word of God says:\r\n\r\n> 25 whom (refering to Christ) God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, -**Romans 3:25 NKJV**\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of the divinde patience or forbearance, God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, that is, the sins of His people who lived prior to Christ's coming. The passing over of sins was not because God is a terrible judge who could not justly punish sins when He should have. Rather, it has a glorious purpose. The purpose is:\r\n\r\n> to demonstrate His righteousness\r\n\r\nHaving passed over the sins of the past, God would appear as unrighteous, not exercising His justice. But God in His sovereignty, chose to exercise His patience towards His people because in His mind, His Son would pay the price for our sins.\r\n\r\nAt the cross, Christ became the _propitiation_ for our sins and the sins that were previously committed. It means that Christ became the very one on which our sins and the sins in the past were laid.\r\n\r\n> And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. -**Isaiah 53:10 NKJV**\r\n\r\nWhose iniquity? Ours, including God's people who lived in the past. On whom were our iniquity laid? Upon Christ! So at the cross Jesus Christ was condemned. He became sin (2 Cor. 5:21), He became cursed and a curse (Gal. 3:13). He was the sacrifice to the Father who satisfied His justice and appeased His wrath. Every sin that were passed over in the past were _endured_ by God for a very long time so that one day all of it would be laid upon His Son. What a love! What a grace!\r\n\r\nThus, God in His forbearance is not unrighteous or unjust because He justly punished our sins upon the bidy of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n## Go back to the cross\r\n\r\nIf you ever feel that you are far from God, know that He is so patient with you. If you think that you're too sinful to come to Him, know that He has rich mercy, abounding grace, and everlasting love for you. All that you need is at the cross. Jesus paid for all of it - completely, perfectly, lovingly, willingly. Remember that the Lord's heart for you is \"Return to Me\". Now run to your Savior who loved you and gave Himself for you.\r\n\r\n-jep\r\n",

      "raw": "\nThe glory of God is the sum and the substance of all that He is. God is infinitely holy and He is utterly perfect. No one is more beautiful than Him given His grandeur and majesty. He reigns with utter sovereignty, absolute authority, and great power. He is dependent to none and yet all depends on Him. He is self-sufficient and in need of nothing. Truly, He is the glorious God.\n\nThe Scripture teaches that the heavens declare the glory of God (Psa. 19:1). All of creation is all about showcasing God’s glory. From the most minute of subatomic particle to celestial bodies such as the stars, all show His manifold attributes. The Scripture also tells us that man was created in the image of God, according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26). Now, the purpose why God created man is also for His own glory. He said,\n\n> Everyone who is called by My name,\n> Whom I have created for My glory;\n> I have formed him, yes, I have made him.”\n> **-Isaiah 43:7**\n\nThe first question in the Westminster Catechism goes like this, _“What is the chief end of man?”_ and the answer is this,_ “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.”_. Yes, that’s why we exist. Our life is never about us so it must not revolved around us. In fact, it is written that,\n\n> …whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God\n> **-1 Corinthians 10:31**\n\nGod displays His glory through the creation and He created us for His own glory. The point is that our lives should be about glorifying Him by enjoying Him forever. However, is that what we see today?\n\n#### **The Fall: Falling Short of God’s Glory**\n\nIt has been widely known among Christians the verse which says, “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)”. But do we really know what it means? What does “have sinned” mean? What does falling short of God’s glory mean? We’ll answer that as we consider the following account of the Fall of man in the Garden of Eden.\n\n> So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.\n> **-Genesis 3:6**\n\nThe Garden of Eden was where God put our first parents, Adam and Eve. There they walked with God and they could freely talk to Him. No chasm was there to divide them. The access to the divine presence was wide open and free. Nothing hindered them from enjoying God. But all of that were only a reality until Eve “saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise”. Being influenced by the serpent’s deception, the created tree of which the fruit was forbidden to be eaten was found good, pleasant, and desirable by Eve. This led her into eating its fruit and then she gave it to her husband Adam and it was at that moment that “through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men (Romans 5:12)”.\n\nIn that narrative we see what it means to fall short of God’s glory. Eve and Adam fell short of God’s glory when they saw that the fruit of the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil was good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and desirable. It was as though God was not enough for them anymore. So they esteemed with higher regard than the glory of God the fruit of the created tree. That shifted desire from a desire for the Creator to the desire for the creation became the framework in which man’s inclination is based. Every man is so radically depraved to the degree that he exchanged the glory of God for a created thing (Romans 1:23). Man’s affections are naturally towards the anything less than God. The creation which is meant to be external to us is now man’s pursuit. Man’s life which is ought to be lived for God’s glory is now being lived wastefully for himself. Oh, what a depraved being we are apart from God’s grace!\n\n#### **The Extent of “Have Sinned”**\n\nMan’s sinfulness goes beyond his actions. Man is a sinner not only because he commits sin but also, or more accurately, that he commits sin because he is a sinner. So man’s sinfulness is not just an issue of behavior, it is an issue of nature. Sin is a nature. It is like a prison. Man follows it and this makes him a “slave of sin (Rom. 6:16,17)” and at the same time it is his pursuit: “we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind (Ephesians 2:3)”.\n\nSin brought spiritual deadness in us. For that reason, we cannot savor the glory of God. We cannot respond to His beauty. We are blinded by sin that we cannot see His infinite worth. Our hearts became a factory of many idols that we cannot regard Him as a precious treasure. We cannot because we will not. It’s not only about having an inability to see Him but it’s really about our lack of willingness to see Him and our lack of desire for Him. Our Lord Jesus Christ testified of this when He said:\n\n> And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and **men loved darkness rather than light**, because their deeds were evil.\n> **-John 3:19**\n\nSo, the light is there but men won’t come for their desire is darkness. Men “loved” darkness rather than the light. So men run to darkness not because there is no light but because they are inclined to it deep within their heart. Now, given our natural condition, how can we regard God again with the highest esteem? How can our enjoyment of Him be restored? How can the divine glory which was trampled and exchanged for lesser things become the most precious treasure of our heart?\n\n#### **Savoring God through Christ**\n\nJesus Christ is the Son of God. He is the image of the invisible God, the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person (Col. 1:15, Heb. 1:3). He is the Word from the beginning and the Word who became flesh (John 1:1, 14a). The Apostle John testified:\n\n> we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\n> **-John 1:14**\n\nJohn later tells us,\n\n> No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.\n> **-John 1:18**\n\nThe point of all that is that Christ is the greatest revelation of God. In Christ, God is revealed. From His birth, in His life, in His ministry, at the cross, in His resurrection to His ascension, God is revealed.\nThe coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is pivotal not only to history but more importantly to the life of a sinful man. The word of God tells us that Jesus was born “for He will save His people from their sins (Matt. 1:21)”. That promise is not only about saving us from the consequences of sins such as God’s wrath, death, and eternal damnation. In that salvation our spiritual regeneration is included. It was said by the LORD Himself,\n\n> Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean;\n> I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols.\n> I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you;\n> I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.\n> I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes,\n> and you will keep My judgments and do them.\n> **-Ezekiel 36:25–27**\n\nThat is the gospel in summary. That promise includes our cleansing and the giving of a new heart to us. That new heart is no longer a heart of stone which is cold towards God. That new heart is a heart the delights in God.\n\nThrough the preaching of the gospel, the person and works of Christ is proclaimed to the unregenerate. By that, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God is given in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 4:6). Thus, if we want to truly behold God in His glory, we have to fix our gaze upon Christ. We have to look to Him continually. “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18)”.\n\nWhen the Lord Jesus said that He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, what He is essentially saying is that He is the Way not only to be with the Father but also the Way to know the Father. He is the Truth through whom we can know all about God. He is the Life who gives us life eternal that we may enjoy God now and for all eternity.\n\nThe Apostle Paul wrote,\n\n> For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.\n> **And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ**, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.\n> **-Romans 5:10–11**\n\nThe reality that we are saved from God’s wrath and that we have now peace with God is indeed worthy to be celebrated. But Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, reminds us that our reconciliation with God through Christ is a cause of rejoicing. He is us that it is only through Christ that we can truly rejoice in God.\n\nSo then, in order to be able to return to God and to savor His glory again, we need Christ. Our original purpose which was marred by sin is restored through Christ. Through Christ we can now rejoice in God. We can now be one with the Psalmist when he said,\n\n> My flesh and my heart fail;\n> But God is the strength of my heart **and my portion foreve**r.\n> **-Psalms 73:26**\n\nWe can now say with confidence that the Lord is our portion forever, meaning that He is all that we have and therefore He is the very Treasure of our hearts. True and lasting joy is in His presence alone as well as the good and satisfying pleasures (Psa. 16:11). And thanks be to God for in blessing us with “every spiritual blessing”, He bestows upon us this great privilege of glorifying Him by enjoying Him forever through our beautiful Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. And this is how we return to God’s glory.\n\n-jep\n",

      "raw": "\n> But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace…\n> **(Ephesians 2:13–14)**\n\nThe believer’s walk is marked with constant collision with the flesh, the world, and the devil. We still live in a fallen world with its fallen system around us. For this reason, we find ourselves oftentimes distracted, confused, and defeated. Eventually, our joy ceases to manifest. We become numb to the degree that we no longer desire the things of God and yet we take pleasures from the things of the world. Our appetite for the sweetness of Christ grows weaker and our affections for the bitter waters of the world become stronger.\n\nWe may constrain ourselves to the commands of Scriptures. We may subject our bodies to godly discipline. We may read how-to books and follow them. But when all is said and done, if it is not the proper fuel when it comes to walking with God, we’ll just end up burnt-out and joyless. As a Christian, we need a better prime mover by which we can be compelled to _“present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service (Romans 12:1)._”\n\nWhat must be the Christian’s constant fuel to be able to enjoy his walk with Christ? David had a prayer written in Psalm 51:12:\n\n> Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,\n> And uphold me by Your generous Spirit.\n> **(Psalms 51:12)**\n\nA deeper appreciation of Christ will grow in us if we are always reminded of the salvation that God has wrought in us through Him. The joy that salvation produces is always there. The problem is man’s appreciation of it becomes lesser as he indulges himself to the things of the world that is why he loses his joy. This is why David said, “_restore **TO ME** the joy of Your salvation_”. Like David, we can only be truly joyful if we are constantly amazed by God’s work of salvation as revealed in the gospel. Ask yourself the question,\n\n> When was the last time that I stand amazed in the grace of God?\n\nIn this post, we will have a closer look to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I trust that the Spirit of God will shine upon our hearts the light of the gospel and will restore to us the joy of God’s salvation. May the Spirit create in us a special love for Christ and His word as we get a deeper understanding of the gospel.\n\n##### **The Gospel is the Gospel of Peace because we were once God’s Enemies.**\n\n> Therefore, remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh — who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands — that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.\n> **(Ephesians 2:11–13)**\n\nPaul told the churches in Ephesus to remember their past state. It may sound off if you are used to hearing expressions such as “don’t think negatively”, “you attract what you think”. When Paul told them to remember who they were, he is essentially telling them to remember their sinful state and what they lack apart from Christ. It is not a call to think negatively or to be sin-conscious. We remember who we were not to condemn ourselves but to appreciate more the glory of the gospel. As the stars shine the brightest on a pitch-black canvas of the night sky, so is the gospel shines the most at the recognition of our past sinful state.\n\nNow, Paul listed what the Ephesians lacked apart from Christ:\n\n- Without Christ;\n- Aliens (foreigners) from the commonwealth of Israel;\n- Strangers from the covenants of promise;\n- Having no hope; and\n- Without God in the world.\n\nGod is the God of Israel. The ethnic Israel is the object upon which God bestows His blessings. They are His chosen nation (Deut. 14:2) and for this reason to them _“pertain the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises (Romans 9:4)”_. Such blessings were not originally given to the Gentiles (other nations). Now, we are Gentiles as well. In the past, we were without Christ and the ultimate effect of this is being without God in the world.\n\nEssentially, without Christ we have no reconciliation with God. In other words, we have no peace with Him. Having no peace with God means we were His enemies. Why is that? We have to go back to what the essence of sin is. To sin is to _“fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)”_ which means to not glorify Him. We have to remember that sinning is more than just committing a silly mistake. It is a willful rebellion against God. Whenever we sin, we are committing a cosmic treason, a rebellion against the Divine. For this reason, our being becomes sinful in nature. We are sinners not because we sin, we sin because we are sinners. Because of our sinfulness we _“were by nature children of wrath, just as the others (Eph. 2:3)”_. We were once an object of God’s wrath and God is wrathful towards His enemies. This is the bad news that only the gospel can solve.\n\n##### **The Gospel is the Gospel of Peace because Christ Himself is our Peace.**\n\nAfter telling the Ephesians to remember their past state, Paul goes on and makes an important transition:\n\n> **But** now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.\n> **(Ephesians 2:13)**\n\nJust like the Ephesians, we were once far off not only because we are not a part of Israel but because we were literally without Christ and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, we have been brought near by the blood of Christ. Remember that the problem is being separated from God so the solution must be a reconciliation.\n\nThe gospel message tells us that we have been brought near by the blood of Christ. That’s the good news there! It is not our own blood that was shed to atone for our sins. It is the precious blood of the Lamb of God that was shed on the cross for the remission of our sins. We know for sure that the blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9), but we have to be reminded that His blood also made us reconciled to God, thus making peace with Him.\n\n> For **He Himself [Christ] is our peace**, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation,\n> **(Ephesians 2:14)**\n\nChrist Himself is our peace with God by His blood. How does it happen? At the cross, Jesus became guilty by imputation. The Prophet Isaiah wrote,\n\n> And the LORD has laid on Him [Christ] the iniquity of us all.\n> **(Isaiah 53:6)**\n\nJesus knew no sin and He has no sin of His own (2 Cor. 5:21) but because our sins were laid or imputed on Him, He became guilty by imputation. In fact, the Father Himself “made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21)”. Christ became sin for us and for this reason He became the object of God’s wrath. We have to remember that God is not only love, He is also just. His justice demands that the guilty be punished that is why the punishment that we deserve fell upon Christ. Christ became the propitiation, that is, a sacrifice that removes wrath. The Father’s wrath was completely satisfied through the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is how He reconciled the sinners to the Holy God thus making peace with Him. Isaiah wrote,\n\n> The chastisement for our peace was upon Him,\n> **(Isaiah 53:5)**\n\nMan can never be right or be at peace with God by his own works. It takes the sacrifice of the sinless, perfect Son of God to reconcile man to God. We can conclude now:\n\n> Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ…**(Romans 5:1)**\n\n##### **The Gospel of Peace produces double reconciliation**\n\n###### **1. Jews and Gentiles reconciled with one another**\n\n> For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace,\n> **(Ephesians 2:14–15)**\n\nRemember that the Gentiles are not part of Israel and thus have no part in the blessings which are for Israel. But Jesus made both (Jews & Gentiles) one by breaking down the middle wall of separation. Now, therefore, the Gentiles are “no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God (Ephesians 2:19)”. We are now one new man in Christ. We are the new creation in Christ.\n\n> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.\n> **(2 Corinthians 5:17)**\n\n###### **2. Jews & Gentiles both reconciled to God**\n\n> …and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.\n> **(Ephesians 2:16–18)**\n\nThe means of God to reconcile us to Himself is the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ. The cross is where the Lord atoned for the sins of many, absorbing God’s wrath thus satisfying His justice. Now, peace is being proclaimed to those who were afar off (Gentiles) and to those who are near (Jews). As the new creation in Christ, we now have access by the Spirit of God to the Father.\n\nThe greatest problem of man is not his empty bank account, not his failing body, not his relationships, not his lack of job, and not his slow temporal success. Such things will be addressed by God if and only if He wills it. But the greatest problem of man is being without Christ and without God in the world or in other words, having no peace with God. The gospel is the only message that tells men how to be reconciled to God.\n\nThe gospel of peace produces joy and comfort in the heart of the believer. Joy, because being reconciled to God, knowing that we were once His enemies, is the ultimate gift one can have. This is also our motivation to know Christ more — His person and His works. The gospel drives us to love Him and His words. The gospel compels us to joyfully pursue Him and to desire Him above all else. The joy that we have from Him enables us to easily abandon all the pleasures in the world. Comfort, because though we are Christians and under the covenant of God’s grace, we are not exempted from this life’s struggles and problems. In fact, Jesus said that in this world we will have tribulation (John 16:33). But the gospel of peace brings comfort in our hearts and reminds us that we are pilgrims in this world and we ought to have our eyes be stamped with eternity so that we will constantly hold on to the hope that is in Christ — the hope that one day we will finally be with God in heaven.\n",

      "raw": "\n> Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed,\n> Because His compassions fail not.\n> — LAMENTATIONS 3:22\n\nGod is divine being. His being is absolute which means that what and who He is never depends on anything outside of Him. There is no standard for His being, He Himself is the standard. It is for this reason that God is indeed incomparable, that He is the LORD and besides Him, there is no other (Isa. 45:5). God is perfect and His attributes tell us of His glory, that is, the sum and the substance of all that He is. His attributes tell us how weighty He is.\n\nThe perfection of God is made known to man by the revelation of His attributes. There is a general revelation of God in which He reveals Himself to all by the creation which He made. “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse (Rom. 1:20)”. Furthermore, “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork (Psa. 19:1)”. Therefore, man is without excuse. Man knows God at least in the cognitive sense and it is confirmed by what he sees and by his conscience.\n\nThere are also instances in which God reveals Himself by bestowing upon man His goodness, mercy, grace, forbearance, wrath, justice, and righteousness. Every single attribute of God that is revealed to us gives us a glimpse of His infinite worth and there is no other place where we can know Him other than His word. A thorough survey of the Scriptures makes us see that God is merciful, gracious, and at the same time He does judgments as an exercise of His justice. As we go along, we’ll see how these attributes differ and what the Bibles says about God’s mercy for the sinner.\n\n##### **MERCY, GRACE, AND JUSTICE**\n\nBefore diving into the mercy of God for a sinner, it is first important for us to understand the distinction between mercy, grace, and justice. Oftentimes mercy is confused with grace and the way God shows mercy is oftentimes mistaken as an act of injustice. So how do these attributes of God differ from one another?\n\nThe justice of God is that which God bestows on sinners for they deserve it. All men sinned and the justice of God demands that the guilty be punished (Exo. 34:7). Men deserve the punishment of death and God is just if He will exercise judgment on the rebellious. The grace of God is that which God gives to the sinner even though they do not deserve it. One example of God showing His grace is when He justified us. The Bible teaches that we are justified freely by His grace (Rom. 3:24). The word “free” then must come to our mind when we hear about God’s grace. Grace is not attained nor achieved; it is only freely given. Now, God shows mercy when He chooses to not give or bestow to sinners that which they deserve. As we go on, we will see why it is not injustice and what the Scriptures teaches about the mercy of God for a sinner.\n\n##### **THE MERCY OF GOD FOR A SINNER**\n\nThe Prophet Jeremiah, under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, wrote: “Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed; Because His compassions fail not (Lam. 3:22)”. Now, don’t we deserve to be consumed, that is, to become undone and die? We do, absolutely! Death is what a sinner deserves. But based on our text, we are not consumed and that means what we deserve didn’t fall upon us. The reason for this is the mercy of God for the sinner. “Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed” — God can choose to deal with the sinner according to His mercies. A similar passage can be found in the New Testament: “But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (Eph. 2:4–5)”. The statement “even when we were dead in trespasses” implies that there is something we deserve for being dead in trespasses (slave to sin, sinful) and that is death, that is us being consumed. But through the richness of His mercy, we have been made alive in Christ which means “we are not consumed”.\n\n##### **THE MERCY AND LOVE OF GOD**\n\nNow we’ll see why in showing mercy God is not unjust. When God deals with a sinner according to His mercy, His motivation is His love. Going back to our key text, “Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed, Because His compassions fail not (Lam. 3:22).” God’s compassion is His passionate love for the sinner. God’s love is Himself willing to show His goodness to the sinner. This compassion of God does not fail. Again, in the similar passage in Ephesians we read, “But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us… (Eph. 2:4)”. There is a divine great love with which God loves the sinner that He is willing to show the sinner the richness of His mercy. David knows this that’s why in one of his gut-wrenching psalms he wrote: “Have mercy upon me, O God; According to Your lovingkindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. (Psa. 51:1)”. What David was pleading was that God would deal with Him according to His love and mercy and not to give him the punishment he deserved. Therefore, when God shows His mercy, He is not doing something that is unjust. What He is actually showing is who He is, being merciful and loving. The mercy of God is not in conflict with His justice. God’s justice, as portrayed in the Scriptures, is always accompanied by His wrath while God’s mercy, as we have already seen, is accompanied by God’s unfailing compassion or great love.\n\n##### **THE SINNER’S CRY FOR MERCY**\n\nThose who truly cry for God’s mercy are those who genuinely came to the understanding of their sinfulness and the just punishment that they deserve. God shows His mercy to the helpless — those who can’t find any hope in themselves. David, in his brokenness, wrote, “Have mercy upon me, O God; According to Your lovingkindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. (Psa. 51:1)”. The tax collector was in absolute despair when he uttered, “God, be merciful to me, a sinner! (Luke 18:13)”. Paul also obtained mercy even though he persecuted the church of God. He wrote, “although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy (1 Tim. 1:12–13)”. These men, among many others, were honest before God. They admitted before Him that they were helpless and that they knew that their only hope is God dealing with them according to His tender mercies and steadfast love. Therefore, the understanding of our sinfulness and that we deserve a punishment far worse than physical death is a gift. It is a wonderful understanding indeed for it makes us run to God to cast ourselves upon His mercies.\n\n_All Scripture quotations are in NKJV._\n",

      "raw": "\nHave you ever wondered why the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ was necessary? If you have ever pondered on that question, I am sure that you’ve been left with a satisfied and amazed heart. At the same time, you probably felt so much humbled as you realized the sinfulness of sin, the just and holy character of God, and the weight of Christ’s atoning work at the cross.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to seek and save the lost (Luke 19:10). However, finding His own is not enough to reconcile them to the Father. This is because God is just and to just simply pardon a sinner without paying the debt that is due to his sins is not a character of a just and holy God. The justice of God requires the condemnation of any one who has sinned against Him. For this reason, we are helpless to save ourselves for all of us have sinned (Romans 3:23). So, one answer to the question of why the atonement is necessary is this: the just and holy character of God. While that answer is about who God is, the second answer is about who we are.\n\n##### **The Sinfulness of Sin**\n\nThe soul who sins shall die (Ezek. 18:4,20). The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23a). All have sinned and have fallen short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23). These horrifying effects of sin tell us that great is its sinfulness. Now, how deep or great do you think is the sinfulness of sin?\n\nSin is so serious because it is committed against the Holy God who is infinitely righteous, whose being is so perfect, whose character is so pure, quite incomprehensible to the human mind. Thus, the punishment to the one who sins against God must be so severe for God is absolutely holy. Since God is just, He will not only punish the sinners, but more importantly He MUST punish them.\n\nTo further understand this, let’s see as taught by the sacred Scriptures, the different ways by which the biblical authors describe sin:\n\n- **Debt**\n\nWhen we sin, we become indebted to God and this debt, we can never pay. We don’t have the ability to pay this debt for to sin is to become morally indebted to God. There isn’t someone among the sinful men from whom we can borrow or get the payment for this debt.\nWhen the Lord Jesus taught the model prayer in Matthew 6, He said this:\n\n> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\n> **(Matthew 6:12)**\n\nThe Lord didn’t mean that we have a monetary debt to God. What’s that about is asking God for forgiveness for our sins. So to sin is to be a debtor to God.\n\n- **Enmity**\n\nEnmity means war. It also refers to hostility or having an ill will or bitter grudge against the opposite party. Now, man in his sinful state is in enmity against God. The Bible teaches this:\n\n> Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be.\n> **(Romans 8:7)**\n\nMan’s desire for sin and his lack of regard for God’s glory is an indication that he doesn’t want God in his mind. Man’s hatred for God leads him to all kinds of excuses to the degree that he denies His existence. This is why there are atheists today who deny the obvious existence of God. They’re not actually atheist for there’s no such person as an atheist. What we have now in the world are liars who just deny what is obvious.\n\n- **Crime**\n\nThe late Dr. R.C. Sproul said, _“Sin is cosmic treason.”_.\n\nThat is absolutely right. Sin is committed against the Holy King, the One who sits on the throne, far above the heavens, seated with authority and reigning in sovereignty. Sin is a heinous crime against the Divine and thus deserving of great punishment. God gave man a command and He plainly told him not to cross a certain line. But man did. Man fell into sin by an act of disobedience and a disobedience of God’s command is sin. Man isn’t entitled to commit one sin. One sin is enough to send him to hell forever. The Bible teaches this:\n\n> Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\n> **(1 John 3:4)**\n\nGod drew the line but we crossed it. God said, “Thou shall not” and we said back to Him, “I will”. He said, “Thou shall” and we willfully rebelled against Him by saying, “I will not”. This is man’s natural inclination. We are naturally law breakers.\n\nThis is the sinfulness of sin. This is the other reason why the atoning work of Christ is indeed necessary. An understanding of what the Bible teaches about sin and the humble, genuine acceptance that we are sinners will surely compel us to cast ourselves upon God’s mercy. Now, God being rich in mercy, didn’t leave us helpless. He provided a way for us to be saved  **_the atonement_** .\n\n##### **The Atonement**\n\nSo now, a question should arise in our minds : “Since God is just and holy and that it is rightful for Him to punish the guilty, how can He forgive sinners?”\n\nThat is a valid and an important question to ask. That’s what theologians call the Divine Dilemma. But the answer is found in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nYou see, Christ came to save sinners from their sins. Even His name “Jesus” literally means “to save” or “savior”. Among the many things which He completely and perfectly did, here are some of them:\n\n- **Forgiveness**\n\nWhile to sin is to become a debtor to God, to be in Christ is to be forgiven of sins. The one who sins shall die for the wages of sin is death. But Christ bore the sins of many and His blood was shed in order for them to be forgiven.\n\n> In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace…\n> **(Ephesians 1:7)**\n\nChrist satisfied the justice and appeased the wrath of God by becoming the propitiation or the sacrifice that removes wrath on our behalf. Christ paid the debt that we could never pay through the shedding of His own precious blood at the cross. God Himself put Christ forward to be the substitute for us (Rom. 3:25).\n\n- **Peace and Reconciliation**\n\nWhile to sin is to be in enmity against God, or to be estranged from Him, to be in Christ is to be reconciled to the Father.\n\n> But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation\n> **(Ephesians 2:13-14)**\n\nOur sins have separated us from God, “But your iniquities have separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from you, So that He will not hear (Isa. 59:2)”. But Christ’s work at the cross which justly removed the wrath of God towards His people made us reconciled to Him. When a person gets born again, he effectively becomes at peace with God. The great divide is no more and the saved can now enjoy God’s presence. This is then the start of the lifelong and eternal enjoyment in and with God as the newly converted regards Him as the ultimate treasure of his heart and the never-ending river and the never-drying well of joy and satisfaction.\n\n- **Ransom**\n\nWhile sin is a crime against God, Christ paid the ransom that is due to our crime. The Lord Himself said,\n\n> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.\n> Mark 10:45\n\nAnd that’s exactly what He did. As the Good Shepherd, He laid down His own life as a ransom for many — the many who are sinful. His blood was the payment, His life was the cost. Rebels like us can now live in life and freedom because the Son of God died at that lonely cross, taking all our sins upon Him, and willfully paying the penalty that is due to such sins. Oh what a love!\n\nHere we see love — that Christ was willing to do what’s necessary in order to save sinful men. While the cross shows us the unimaginable horrors of sin and the wrath of God, we also see there the demonstration of God’s love with which He loved the ungodly (Rom. 5:8). Oh! What a beautiful truth indeed!\n\nSo why was the atonement necessary?\n\nGod is holy and just and we’re not. As sinners we are debtors, in enmity with God, and criminals before God. But Christ’s substitutionary atonement at the cross made the forgiveness of our sins possible, provided a way for us to be reconciled to the holy God having all charges against us completely dismissed, and paid the ransom that is due to our sins. By His atoning work at the cross, God’s justice was satisfied and His wrath was appeased. His love was demonstrated and the sinners are rescued and His Name is now and forever glorified! ☺\n\nOne final note, when you think about the cross, think of the vertical part of it as what Christ has done for the Father — satisfying His justice, absorbing His wrath, paying our debts by His blood and the horizontal part of it as the effects of His perfect work — debts forgiven, sinners reconciled, ransom paid.\n\nAlways remember that! ☺\n",

      "raw": "\n> The words of the LORD are pure words,\n> Like silver tried in a furnace of earth,\n> Purified seven times.\n>\n> Psalms 12:6\n\nThen word of the LORD are truly pure and this truth teaches us that the LORD is also pure. The LORD is pure and what comes from Him is also pure. _God is light and in Him is no darkness at all (1 John 1:5)_.\n\nNow, what does it mean for the word of God to be pure? Here's what I can find as I survey the Scriptures:\n\n## It means the word of God is trusthworthy\n\nSince the word of the Lord is pure, no blemish or deceit is in it. But notice that in our text, it is liken to a purified silver that was purified seven times. So, God's word is not only pure due to its inherent purity and moral and ethical perfection but also because it passed the test of time. Through fiery trials, the word of God has been proven to be true and steadfast. The Psalmist testified,\n\n> As for God, His way is perfect;\n> The word of the LORD is proven;\n> He is a shield to all who trust in Him.\n>\n> 2 Samuel 22:31\n\nThe word of God in its purity can be trusted. In fact, we express how much we trust God by trusting His word. The word of God is proven and this is why it is absolutely trustworthy. As believers whose only hope is the Lord, we can expect that whatever the Lord has said won't return to Him void but it shall accomplish what He pleases (Isaiah 55:11).\n\n## It means the word of God is enlightening\n\nThe Psalmist wrote,\n\n> The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes;\n>\n> Psalms 19:8b\n\nThe _eyes_ that is being referred here is not the physical eyes of man for if it is, all would have known God. It is the eyes of the heart which the apostle Paul referred to in Ephesians 1:18. The natural man's main malady is not a problem with the optic nerve but a darkened, blinded heart. The heart is where all kinds of darkness sit and only the pure word of God can enlighten it. The enemy continuously blinds the unregenerate man. Paul wrote that for those who are perishing, their minds _\"the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them (2 Corinthians 4:4)\"_. So, what the enemy is trying to prevent is the shining of the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ upon the heart of men. So then, what does it mean to be enlighten by the pure word? It means to have a revelation of who God is in the face of Jesus Christ.\n\n> For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\n>\n> 2 Corinthians 4:6\n\nBut _how_ does God reveal Himself to us these days? It is by knowing the Lord Jesus Christ through the written word. In the pure word of God, He makes Himself known to us. The knowledge of God and His word are inseparable for it is the word of God that tells us who God is.\n\n## It means the word of God is desirable\n\nAs the Psalmist wrote referring to the word of God,\n\n> More to be desired are they than gold,\n> Yea, than much fine gold;\n> Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.\n>\n> Psalms 19:10\n\nEven up to this day, gold is the basis of a nation's economy. Without it, a country has no means of producing money and various resources. This is how valuable it is. Many covet gold and many would go and do unspeakable things just to gain it. Gold symbolizes anything temporary that man pursues and holds dearly in his heart. It is his treasure. But for the one who has indeed \"tasted that the Lord is gracious\" (1 Peter 2:3), to those who are born again, the word of God is more desirable than gold, even than much fine gold.\n\nThe word of God is worthy of all godly desires and affections. The saved person finds delight in it. It is the pursuit of the man of God. It is the precious treasure for which a man of God is so willing to dig for in it are riches that this world can never afford. The man who finds the pure word of God will surely esteem it with the hightest regard and value. The Psalmist gladly exclaimed,\n\n> Your word is very pure;\n> Therefore Your servant loves it.\n>\n> Psalms 119:140\n\nThe cause is the purity of God's word, the resolve or conclusion is a love for it. So, the purity of God's word should not only cause us to salute its moral or ethical perfection but it should also lead us to joyfully desire and love it. The word of God is so much more than a book of rules and stories. Tt is a treasure chest of beauty and all preciousness where the Lord of glory is magnified and revealed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll these things wonderfully expressed who the Lord is. He is the author and the keeper of His word. AS His word is trusthworthy, He is trusthworthy. As He is light, He enlightens us as he reveals Himself to us through the word for it is His pleasure to unveil our eyes in order for us to see Him. His word is desirable for He is desirable. The Lord is the only worthy treasure and it is just a wonderful blessing to savor and pursue Him through His word.\n",

      "raw": "\nIt's the season of the so-called Holy Week again. This is the week where religious people commemorate the passion of Christ from His entrance to Jerusalem to His crucifixion, death, burial, and resurrection. During this time of the year, church ministers commonly prepare sermons that have the sufferings of Christ as the theme. One popular _topic_ is what is commonly referred to as the _7 Last Words_.\n\nAmong the last words of our Lord during His suffering is recorded by Apostle John:\n\n> After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, “I thirst!”\n>\n> John 19:28\n\nTwo simple words, \"I thirst\". Because of its simplicity, it's meaning and significance is most often overlook. People also tend to come up with different, even wild, interpretations for it. But in order for us to truly understand _why_ and _what_ Jesus meant when He uttered those words, we will look no further than the Scriptures for it is sufficient in revealing to us the truth of God.\n\n## The reason for the utterance of \"I thirst\"\n\nWhy did Jesus have to utter these words? It is true that He was really and painfully drained of physical strength and was suffering with severe dehydration. Just imagine being nailed on a tree, carrying your own weight while experiencing an excruciating pain. So yes, our Lord was really thirsty that's why He said those words. However, there is something deeper than that. John tells us:\n\n> After this, Jesus, ...**that the Scripture might be fulfilled**, said, “I thirst!”\n>\n> John 19:28\n\nHe said the words so \"that the Scripture might be fulfilled\". Thus, it is vital for us to find that specific Scripture that Jesus was fulfilling during that time.\n\n## Christ fulfilled the Law and is the Fulfillment of the Law\n\nEven from His birth, our Lord was fulfilling the things _concerning Himself_ (Luke 24:27). We are taught that Christ is being _witnessed_ or _testified_ by Law and the Prophets (Romans 3:21). Paul tells us in Romans 10:4 that \"Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness\". The word _\"end\"_ here does not mean that Christ only comes after the Law but rather He is the _aim_ of the Law, that is, the Law points to Him. Our Lord Jesus Himself said:\n\n> For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; **for he wrote about Me**.\n>\n> John 5:46\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law and the Prophets. But not only that, He _is_ the very fulfillment of the Scriptures. He obeyed the Law perfectly and the Scriptures is all about Him. No one can fulfill the Law but Christ alone and no one can _be_ the fulfillment of the Law but Christ alone. Our Lord said,\n\n> Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come—\n> In the volume of the book it is written of Me—\n> To do Your will, O God.’\n>\n> Hebrews 10:7\n\nGod's will is revealed in the Scriptures and it is the book that is written of Christ and He came into the world to fulfill it, that is, to do His Father's will. Moreover, our Lord testified:\n\n> Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to **fulfill**.\n>\n> Matthew 5:17\n\nSo, everytime we read the Law or the Prophets, may we not look at it as abolished but as fulfilled by Christ and Him as its fulfillment.\n\nIt is now established that when Jesus said, \"I thirst\", it is all about fulfilling the Scripture.\n\n## The Fulfilled Scripture\n\nNow what is that Scripture? It is found in one of many _messianic_ texts in all of Scriptures:\n\n> My strength is dried up like a potsherd,\n> And My tongue clings to My jaws;\n> You have brought Me to the dust of death.\n>\n> Psalms 22:15\n\nHere we see why Jesus was thirsty when He was at the cross. His strength was dried up and His tongue clung to His jaws. These are expressions of severe dryness of the mouth and dehydration. But why was His strength dried up? The obvious answer is because He became weak as He received the beatings, the scourgings, the mockings, not to mention the additional pain induced by the crown of thorns and the heavy cross. All of such things are valid reasons that caused His strength to become dry. But there's (again) something deeper here.\n\n## What's in the cup?\n\nJesus' strength was dried up that He became extremely thirsty. But it was not only because of the physical causes. We have to remember why Jesus was at the cross during this time. He was there not for His own sin but for our sins. He was there to suffer in our place as if He was the one who committed our sins. He was there, the Just for the unjust. Let us also not forget that before He was arrested, He said these deep words:\n\n> saying, “Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.”\n>\n> Luke 22:42\n\nAs part of the will of the Father for which our Lord Jesus came into the world, there's the cup that He must drink. Apparently, the usage of a cup is for drinking. In the case of Christ, what was in the cup? It was not a delicious grape wine. It is the cup containing the full measure of God's wrath against the sins of the elect. That's what He drank! For every sin of God's people committed from Adam's fall until the second coming of Christ, God's demand (for He is just) is death, curse, and alienation from Him. These are all contained in His wrath against the sinners and their sins. The wrath of God is the content of the cup that Jesus drank on that cross.\n\nSo how could not His strength dry up if it was God's wrath that He drank? Imagine the weight of it. Imagine the weight or the glory of its Source. Jesus absorbed it all. Fully. Completely. Not a drop was left. He left not a drop for any other to drink. He drank it all. He truly became the \"propitiation for our sins (Romans 3:25)\" as He took upon Himself the wrath of God.\n\nHere's what's even more painful. The wrath that was poured out to Him for Him to drink came from His own Father. The love that the Father has shown here is immeasureable and no human mind can ever comprehend its depth. He loves us enough to turn His back from His beloved Son and to let Him drink His wrath that was due to our sins. There's no greater love than the love which Christ demonstrated here as well. He loves us indeed to the end (John 13:1). He loves us enough that He was willing to come into this world knowing what He would do, knowing what He would suffer for the sake undeserving sinners. What love could be greater than the Father giving up His Son and the Son laying down His life for the redemption of many?\n\n## Thirsty Savior, Satisfied sinners\n\nEvery bit of what God's justice demands was provided and paid for through the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. Having drank the full measure of God's wrath, He fully satisified God's justice and removed His wrath upon the elect. He became thirsty as he drank God's wrath so that we can be satisfied in God having been reconciled to Him. We are now reconciled to the Father when we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ:\n\n> For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit\n>\n> 1 Peter 3:18\n\nChrist suffered once for sins. That means, His sacrifice is only once but for all time, for all sins, and for all the elect. He suffered the wrath of God so we can be with Him forever. Now that we're in Him, Jesus promised us:\n\n> And Jesus said to them, \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.\"\n>\n> John 6:35\n\nAs we believe in what the Lord has done for us, we will certainly be satisfied in Him. Our thirsty souls will be satisfied. It will be like a well-watered garden. All we have to do is to fix our eyes on Him (Hebrews 12:2). Look to Him and be satisfied for as we look to Him, our gracious Father is revealed in Him for the glory of God is revealed in the face of Christ (2 Corinthians 4:4-6). Our Savior became thirsty at the cross so that we'll no longer be thirsty in our souls as we look to Him.\n\n-jep\n",

Is it that fancy car or an unexpected promotion? Is it that big, beautiful house? Or perhaps the healing from an illness that you’re longing for? Or maybe the blessing of being healthy? Could it be a wonderful marriage, restored relationships, or even a fruitful ministry? All those things are blessings indeed for “every good gift and every perfect gift is from above (James 1:17)”. If the Lord wills, surely such blessings can and will come to us.\n\nThe things mentioned above are the very ones over which we even cry for. We pray earnestly for these things for such are the desires of our hearts. What we pray for is what we desire. However, if our prayer revolves around these things quite often, we miss the point of our salvation. As hard as it is to admit, there’s no guarantee that the Lord will give us those things. That is not to say that we should stop praying for these things. “Let your requests be made known to God (Philippians 4:6)”. What we are trying to point out here is that how far can our requests go? How much depth can our prayer have? How much desire can we express through prayer?\n\n## A Deeper Request\n\nAs I survey the Scriptures, there are people of God who had deep prayer requests. One is Moses. Consider his great request to God:\n\n> And he said, “Please, show me Your glory.”\n>\n> Exodus 33:18\n\nGreat right? Here’s the Lord’s response:\n\n> But He said, “You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.”\n> Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.”\n>\n> Exodus 33:20,23\n\nMoses’ request to see the glory of the Lord was granted however it was not His face that He allowed him to see but only His back.\n\nHere’s another man of God, Paul the Apostle. Look at his deep desire to know Christ:\n\n> For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.\n>\n> 1 Corinthians 2:2\n\nHere we see a man who had no other mission in life but to know Christ and to proclaim Him. Paul showed us that it is possible to “count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:8)”. His desire for Christ far outweighed any desire that he might have for the things of the world. “That I may know Him” – that was his cry, the deep longing of his soul.\n\n## Only the Pure in Heart shall see God\n\nWe have surely read what Jesus said as He taught the so-called Beatitudes (Matthew 5) about what is required in order for a man to see God.\n\n> Blessed are the pure in heart,\n> For they shall see God.\n>\n> Matthew 5:8\n\nThe idea is quite simple. _Only the pure in heart shall see God_. If there’s any blemish in the heart, that already blocks the vision of God. Seeing God requires His beholder to be pure. Utter perfection is necessary to behold Him who is perfect. No one is like the Lord. His beauty is matchless, His glory is infinite, His perfection is divine but only the pure in heart is granted the blessing to behold Him. The purity that every heart needs in order to see God is not constrained nor defined by mere behavior and words. It is being without blemish and truly separate from sin. This is testified as well by the Psalmist:\n\n> Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD?\n> Or who may stand in His holy place?\n>\n> He who has clean hands and a pure heart,\n> Who has not lifted up his soul to an idol,\n> Nor sworn deceitfully.\n>\n> Psalms 24:3-4\n\nIn that text first we see what it means to see the Lord. Seeing the Lord means being where He is and standing in His holy place. We also see here what it means to be pure in heart. A man who has a pure heart has not lifted up his soul to an idol. An idol is anything that is so much less than God yet man desires and pursues and allows to be enthroned in his heart. It is anything that dethrones God. It is anything where man feeds from when he is longing for satisfaction. It is the well from which man draws water that won’t ever satisfy.\n\nNow the hard truth that all of us should face is that all of us have sinned and fall short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23) and none is righteous, not even one (Romans 3:10). We are sinners by nature, by conduct, and by choice. Sin caused us to be separated from God. It created a veil in our eyes. It darkened the eyes of our heart. It left us ignorant of who God is and unfeeling towards His glory. It made our heart like a cold stone that has no life in it. It is true that all sort of curses that we experience in the present time are results of Adam’s sin. Poverty, sickness, sufferings – all these things are by-products of sin. _But the greatest curse that we get to inherit is the separation from God and the blindness to His glory._\n\nGiven that that is the case, if left to our own we cannot stand before God...we shall not see His glorious face. No matter how much we cry for God to show us His glory, He won’t simply grant our request because of the chasm that our sins have caused. His holiness and justice demand that before anyone can see His face, he must first have a pure heart.\n\n## Made righteous to see God\n\n> For the LORD is righteous;\n> he loves righteous deeds;\n> the upright shall behold his face.\n>\n> Psalms 11:7 ESV\n\nHere we see that the LORD is righteous and the upright shall behold His face. As what the Lord Jesus taught, the pure in heart, that is, the upright, is promised that that they shall see God. Jesus said that they’re “blessed” for there is no greater blessing than being able to see the face of God. But as we have already established earlier, sin must be given a solution for a man is just like a dead corpse who is not only able to see God but also has no desire to see Him if he is left to his radically depraved state.\n\nThe only way for a sinful man to be righteous and pure is for God Himself to clothe him with His own righteousness…and that is exactly what God did. _The robe of righteousness that we must be clothed with is found in the Lord Jesus Christ alone._ Paul gave us a profound summary of what happened at the cross where Jesus bled and died that paved the way for us to be righteous:\n\n> For He (the Father) made Him (Christ) who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.\n>\n> 2 Corinthians 5:21 (emphasis added)\n\nBefore God could clothe us with His own righteousness and be called His righteousness, He laid upon Christ the iniquity of us all (Isaiah 53:6). He _imputed_ to Him all our sins so at the cross, Christ was wrapped with man’s sin and shame. He who knew no sin was made sin so that those who will believe in His name would become the righteousness of God in Him. Moreover, when we say that our righteousness is found in Christ alone, we also mean that not only His works paved the way for us to be righteous but that _He Himself is our righteousness_. The Prophet Jeremiah prophesied this and it was fulfilled in Christ:\n\n> In His days Judah will be saved,\n> And Israel will dwell safely;\n> Now this is His name by which He will be called:\n>\n> THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.\n>\n> Jeremiah 23:6\n\nJesus Christ is the Branch of Righteousness that would come forth from David and the name by which He will be called is **THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS**. Jesus Christ is our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). Therefore, _the righteousness that we have in Him by faith does not only rest on His works but also on who He is_. This also means that nothing from and in us is God’s basis for calling us righteous. It is all the Lord’s work and it is wonderful indeed. Grace, wonderful grace!\n\n## We shall see God\n\nThe sin problem which is man’s greatest malady is now completely given a solution. By faith, we are now counted righteous in Christ and He is now our righteousness. This righteousness is what makes us pure and not our good works. Our best deeds cannot add value to it for this righteousness is already perfect in and of itself. Our worst deeds cannot diminish its worth for no level of blemish can pierce through this righteousness. It is indeed the “best robe” that the loving Father gives for every prodigal who will come back to Him.\n\nHaving made righteous in Christ by faith and having Christ as our righteousness, we shall now see God. The “veil is already taken away in Christ (2 Cor. 3:14)”. So now, “we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord. (2 Corinthians 3:18)”. Our heart is darkened no more for God “has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. (2 Corinthians 4:6)”. We can now be bold enough like Moses to say to God, “show me Your glory” expecting that He will surely reveal Himself to us. Moreover, the priestly blessing is now a reality in our life:\n\n> The LORD make His face shine upon you,\n> And be gracious to you...\n>\n> Numbers 6:25\n\nThe purity of our hearts now comes with a deep desire to see God. Yes, the Lord will now let us see Him. He will even make His face to shine on us in the face of Jesus Christ. But it is both our duty and privilege to desire Him. However, this desire for Him is not produced by us. It is His inner work in us that causes us to desire Him – and this is the wonderful miracle of the new birth.\n\nWhat a wonderful blessing it is to be part of “the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face. (Psalms 24:6)”. The righteousness then that we have in Christ is not an end but a means to a far greater end. The means is becoming righteous by faith, the end is to see God in Christ. So therefore, the greatest blessing of a believer is God Himself. Every blessing and wondrous work that He wrought in us in Christ and by the power of the Holy Spirit leads to enabling us to truly, deeply, passionately, and lovingly desire Him and embrace Him as all-surpassing and ever-satisfying. What we could never do due to our sinfulness was done by the Lord Jesus Christ so that we can be reconciled back to God and having now reconciled with Him we can now freely make much of Him. This is the blessing of the righteous and this blessing is what we ought to live out for the rest of our lives until our faith turns to sight.\n\n-jep\n",

      "raw": "\nThe one thing that most people want other people to see is the thing that is most valuable to them. The one that we value the most is that which is most precious to us. It is the treasure of our hearts, our ultimate desire. This is what makes us excited for almost every day. This is what people believe in.\n\nLook at social media. People display priceless moments depicted in lovely photos. People share heartfelt memories. People showcase their business and the products that they sell. People share amazing stories about the goodness in humanity. People post their ideologies, point of views, perspectives and other things which are meaningful and indeed valuable to them. The soon-to-be-married couple parade their prenuptial photos and videos while the newly weds flaunt their sweet moments in their graceful wedding attires along with their ever supportive friends and relatives. Group of friends always boast their fun escapades and refreshing adventures. People also engage in debates and forums to defend what they believe in.\n\nWe have seen now that people have this natural desire to unveil before others what they are fond of the most, what they treasure, and what they believe in. However I can’t help but notice that there is a group of people who is so silent about the very thing that they profess is the most valuable to them — the Christians.\n\nChristians know and hold the very truth in which their salvation from sin is founded. To them was given the revelation about the predetermined plan of salvation from sins. To them was unveiled the very person of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. To them was granted the forgiveness of multitudes of sins. To them was imputed the righteousness of Christ for free — it is free for them while the Lord Jesus Christ suffered for it. They know the most valuable thing on the face of the earth and that is to know the Lord and to follow Him. They know that the only way to the Father is Christ and no religion can provide people salvation. They know the Only Truth that can truly set free a man from all bondages. They know the Author of Life who’s the Only One who can give a man eternal life. They know it all.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ was witnessed by the early Apostles. They had seen and heard Him firsthand. They were witnesses of His death, burial, resurrection and ascension. That’s why after the Holy Spirit had been given to them as written in the Book of Acts, they were so bold in proclaiming that Jesus is Lord and that there is no other name under heaven by which a man can be saved (Acts 4:12). They even had threats from the chief priests and Jewish rulers back then but they were so eager to preach Christ crucified. The Apostle Peter said, “for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard. (Acts 4:20).\" That was the deep desire which consumed them all and compelled them to spread the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ — crying out to the people, on a daily basis, that they should repent, turn from their sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. This is indeed the most important for the early disciples of Christ so they poured out their all to the gospel, to continue in faith no matter what persecutions they might face. This is what drives them. In their hearts, there was always this urgency to go from town to town just to tell all kinds of people the truth!\n\nIs that what the Christians nowadays do and cry out on a daily basis? No! What I see are Christians who are more excited for the latest movies and TV series out there. What I see are Christians who say they believe but denying the power of what they believe in their lives. What I see are Christians who worship with their lips but having a heart that’s far from God. What I see are Christians who are passionate for their businesses or work or studies but have no desire for the word of God. What I see are Christians who wear Christian TShirts thinking that doing so makes them a real one. If Christians believe that the most valuable to have and know is Jesus Christ, shouldn’t they be out there shouting from the house tops this very thing? If they know that the world is getting messier and people are hopeless, shouldn’t they be out there proclaiming that God is a Father to the orphan, the help for the widow, the Provider for the poor, the Hope to the hopeless, the Light in the darkness and the only salvation from sins? I mean, if you know that someone is about to be hit by a big truck, will you just stand and stare or will you come running towards that person and tackle him in order to save him? Many Christians are just professing, they don’t really value what they believe in or should I say do they really believe? Many genuine Christians are dying on a daily basis in many nations because they confessed with boldness that Jesus is Lord in the midst of threats and persecutions. They persevere even they don’t have food and are in jail. Some are even hiding underground. Some don’t have a complete copy of the Bible. Whereas here in my nation where everyone is free to speak out what they believe in and where technology is very much accessible, Christians are still silent.\n\nWhat we believe can be contagious. But how can a fire become a wildfire if it’s not accompanied by heavy rushing wind? The same is true with the Christians. How can the Gospel be proclaimed if the appointed messengers are sleeping? The Apostle Paul got it right\n\n> **Romans 10:13-14**\n> For \"everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?For \"everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?\n\nChristians, stop being a sleeper. Abandon your excuses and live out your holy calling. To you have been entrusted the ministry of reconciliation. You are called an ambassador of Christ. You are not of the world so please stop loving the things in the world that God absolutely despises. You are sent into the world to go to the lost and to tell them the truth. Don’t receive the grace of God in vain. The truth of the gospel is so precious just to be kept in your closet. The world cannot know hope if you won’t speak. Preach the word my Christian friends, preach the word. Preach the word.\n",

      "raw": "\r\n> **It's the most wonderful time of the year**.\r\n> **It's the season to rejoice**\r\n\r\n-that's what we hear from many during the holidays in December.\r\n\r\nI think the majority of the whole world is most excited about the December holidays. It is that time of the year where families get reunited, where blessings are recounted, where people enjoy good food and gatherings, and where people give and receive gifts. It's quite wonderful, right? But what really is this _time_ of the year about? Yes, it is worth celebrating, but are we celebrating it right or do we even know what we are celebrating in the first place? Yes, it is wonderful, but what makes it wonderful?\r\n\r\nBefore I continue, I would like to say that it is not my aim to address _when_ Christ was born. My aim in this post is to help people see what the Scriptures tell us about the essence of the birth of Christ. It is not so much about when He was born but **why** He was born. Now that that is clear and settled, I would like to move on laying down what the Word of God says about the reason why Jesus Christ needed to be born.\r\n\r\n## The reality of sin, our sinfulness, and God's wrath\r\n\r\nIt is of great importance that we understand first why the birth of Jesus is worth celebrating. In order to grasp its essence, we need first to have a grasp of the reality of sin, our sinfulness, and the wrath of God. Sin is a reality and it is heinous. It is a crime and can be regarded as a great treason. It is worthy of eternal punishment for it is committed against the eternally holy God. The Bible teaches,\r\n\r\n> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\r\n> -Romans 3:23\r\n\r\nand it is for this reason that\r\n\r\n> There is none righteous, no, not one\r\n> -Romans 3:10\r\n\r\nTo sin against God is to wage war against Him and it is a fearful thing. To sin against Him is a treason worthy of death. Thus, a sinner has no peace **with** God. His greatest malady is not his lack of job or food nor his empty bank account - it is his sin and the wrath of God that abides in him due to his sin (John 3:39).\r\n\r\nSo, a sinner must be punished for God is just and holy. He cannot just sweep our sins under a rag and call it a day. God upholds His character in everything that He does. Thus, He does not let even a single sin to go unpunished (Exodus 34:7). If we think that doing good works can neutralize our sinfulness, we're simply wrong. No matter how sincere we are in doing good thinking that we can work our way to heaven, we're just wrong for even all our righteousness are just filthy rags before Him (Isaiah 64:6).\r\n\r\n## No peace with God\r\n\r\nAgain, to sin is to wage war against God and it is for this reason that a sinner has no peace **with** Him. Having no peace with Him means being far from Him. It means an utter separation from Him. It means not having His life. It means not having Him as our joy and treasure. It means having a great divide between us and Him. It means that His holy wrath abides in us (John 3:39). It means that we are children of His wrath (Ephesians 2:3). It means we're in the dark and darkened in mind and heart at the same time (Romans 1:21, Ephesians 4:18). It means that we loved darkness rather than the light (John 3:19). It means hopelessness. It meanns having no hope and without God in the world (Ephesians 2:12).\r\n\r\nThis is the state of a sinful man, the state of having no peace with the Lord.\r\n\r\n## The Savior was born!\r\n\r\nBut then, God loves His own - those whom He chose for Himself before the foundation of the world. When the fullness of time had come, Paul tells us:\r\n\r\n> when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.\r\n> -Galatians 4:4-5\r\n\r\nThe Son of God was born in Bethlehem. So the season that we celebrate each year is not so much about the date, it is about the incarnation of the Son of God, it is about God Himself becoming like one of us and dwelling among us (John 1:14) to redeem us from all of our sins.\r\n\r\nNow let us go back for a moment to our malady which is sin. Sin is the greatest problem of man and the Lord Jesus Christ is the salvation from sin. Look at what the Angel told Joseph about the Lord Jesus:\r\n\r\n> And she (Mary) will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.\r\n> -Matthew 1:21\r\n\r\nThe role of the Son of God is in His Name - He will save His people from their sins. So, the Son of God was born as a man for a purpose and that is to save His people from their sins. And that's exactly what He did. At the cross, He took our sins upon Him. He committed no sin. He had no sin of His own yet He suffered as if He did. He truly came \"to give his life a ransom for many\" (Mark 10:45). When He paid the price that we could never pay, what was written concerning Him was fulfilled:\r\n\r\n> For unto us a Child is born,\r\n> Unto us a Son is given;\r\n> And the government will be upon His shoulder.\r\n> And His name will be called\r\n> Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God,\r\n> Everlasting Father, **Prince of Peace**.\r\n> -Isaiah 9:6\r\n\r\nHe is prophesied to be the Prince of Peace. But why? Yes, he gives peace that surpasses all understanding. He gives us peace from all our worries. He is peace and the very source of it. But the depth of Him being the Prince of Peace is that He became our peace **with** God. He did not come just to give us the peace **of** God but to become our very peace with God. Paul tells us:\r\n\r\n> But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.\r\n> For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation\r\n> -Ephesians 2:13-14\r\n\r\n## So, why the Prince of Peace?\r\n\r\nJesus Christ became our peace with God when He took our sins and was punished at the cross for them. At the cross Him who knew no sin became sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). He who is the Blessed One became a curse and the bearer of our curse (Galatians 3:10-13). What He did at the cross is perfectly laid out by the Prophet Isaiah:\r\n\r\n> Surely He has borne our griefs\r\n> And carried our sorrows;\r\n> Yet we esteemed Him stricken,\r\n> Smitten by God, and afflicted.\r\n> But He was wounded for our transgressions,\r\n> He was bruised for our iniquities;\r\n> The chastisement for our peace was upon Him\\_,\r\n> And by His stripes we are healed.\r\n> -Isaiah 53:4-5\r\n\r\nThe chastisement for our peace was upon Him. It means that the punishment, the curse, the wrath that should fall on us fell upon Him. He received them all willingly and out of pure love. We now rejoice over the reality that through faith in Christ, we have now peace with God. The greatest reconciliation that we can have is now ours because of Him.\r\n\r\n> Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\r\n> -Romans 5:1\r\n\r\nChrist's sacrifice at the cross brought us to God (1 Peter 3:18). We're no longer far from Him. We can now have Him as our very joy and the source of our joy. He can now freely enjoy treasuring Him and savoring His grace, lovingkindness, and goodness.\r\n\r\nI don't know what your reason is when you _celebrate_ this season. But my hope and prayer is that that this writing changes you heart with regards to this season. Again, we celebrate the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for we know and we believe that He is our Savior from our sins, that without Him, no amount of our works can reconcile us with the holy God.\r\n\r\nI hope that the next time we celebrate this season, let's sit down for a moment and remember why our Lord Jesus came. Let us stop for a moment and pour out our grateful heart to Him for saving us from our sins.\r\n\r\n-jep\r\n",

      "raw": "\n## Unashamed to Being Shameful\n\nAs it is written, God created man in His own image and likeness (Genesis 1:21). He created them male and female and put them in the Garden of Eden. There they could experience the very presence of God. We are told from the Scriptures that \"they were both naked, the man and his wife, and _were not ashamed_ (Genesis 2:25)\". The concept of nakedness was not known to them at that time. They didn't mind their nakedness but they were blessed to be able to walk and live with God in the Garden. No shame was felt by them, nor did it come to their minds. Since they were unashamed, all that there was was their relationship with each other and with God.\n\nBut sin came into the world through the cunning serpent when he deceived Eve to take the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil which the Lord told them not to eat. Now, what was the immediate result of their disobedience? Sin entered the world and death through sin (Romans 5:12) and one of the devastating results of sin is shame. We read in Genesis 3:7:\n\n> Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.\n>\n> Genesis 3:7\n\nThe knowledge of their nakedness began after they sinned. They took coverings for themselves and they hid themselves from the Lord.\n\n> And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.\n>\n> Genesis 3:8\n\nBefore their fall, they were unashamedly enjoying the presence of the Lord but now they were hiding from Him. Shame began to fill their being that it also produced fear in them. We see here that shame and fear always go together.\n\n> Then the LORD God called to Adam and said to him, “Where are you?”\n> So he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.”\n>\n> Genesis 3:9-10\n\n## Shameful Sin\n\nIn this narrative we also see the grim reality of sin. Sin is shameful. Sin not only produces shame in man but it is also shameful in itself. Man does not need to sin a lot to be greatly ashamed for one sin is enough for him to be covered with shame. There is nothing honorable in sin. It is vile and loathsome. There is no beauty in it. There is nothing desirable in it. In fact, since man is a sinner, even his best deeds are considered like filthy rags before the Lord:\n\n> But we are all like an unclean thing,\n> And all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags\n>\n> Isaiah 64:6\n\nOur sin is like a leprosy that though we dress ourselves in white garment or wash ourselves with clean soap, its stain will still surface. Job testified,\n\n> If I wash myself with snow water,\n> And cleanse my hands with soap,\n> Yet You will plunge me into the pit,\n> And my own clothes will abhor me.\n>\n> Job 9:30-31\n\nThe Lord Himself said the same thing through the Prophet Jeremiah,\n\n> “For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap,\n> Yet your iniquity is marked before Me,” says the Lord GOD.\n>\n> Jeremiah 2:22\n\nBeing a shameful sinner, we can surely hide like what Adam and Eve did. But in the sight of the Holy God, no sin is hidden. The sinful heart of man is exposed before Him. Our God sees it all.\n\n## A First Glimpse of Redemption\n\nGoing back to the Garden in the Fall narrative. It was an event full of maladies. The LORD cursed the deceitful serpent. He cursed the woman by making her child-bearing too painful. He also cursed the ground for Adam's sake. But after all was said by the LORD, He did a gracious act of covering Adam and Eve.\n\n> Also for Adam and his wife the LORD God made tunics of skin, and clothed them.\n>\n> Genesis 3:21\n\nNote that they were already dressed with their man-made fig leaves coverings but the Lord changed their dressing into a tunic made from an animal skin. The man-made covering for shame was replaced with one that was made and graciously given by God. This is the first glimpse of redemption which would unfold through the Scriptures.\n\n## The One Who Redeemed Us From Shame\n\nNow, let us talk about the One who redeemed us from shame. In order for us to be free from sin and shame, Someone had to take our place and had to pay the price that any one of us could never pay. We know that the Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God and He came down, sent by God the Father, to dwell among us. Paul wrote,\n\n> who (Jesus Christ), being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.\n>\n> Philippians 2:6-7\n\nHere we see the King of Glory, deserving of all praise and acclaim, who made Himself of no reputation. He is the King of Majesty by whom all things were created yet He took the form of a bondservant and came in the likeness of men. The Lord of all preciousness, fairest of all became a servant for sinners' sake.\n\nThis is how, as the suffering Servant, the Lord Jesus Christ suffered:\n\n> Just as many were astonished at you,\n> So His visage was marred more than any man,\n> And His form more than the sons of men;\n>\n> Isaiah 52:14\n\nIsaiah saw how the Lord suffered at Calvary. The horrors as well as the glory of His sufferings were revealed to him. He wrote that the Lord's visage or appearance was marred more than any man. The word _\"marred\"_ means impaired, disfigured, or ruined. Moreover, Isaiah tells us,\n\n> For he grew up before him like a young plant,\n> and like a root out of dry ground;\n> he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,\n> and no beauty that we should desire him.\n>\n> Isaiah 53:2\n\nThe one who formed all things became of no form. The one who is King of majesty became someone without any beauty. The one to whom every good affection should go became someone who is not desirable. He was truly rejected and despised by men.\n\nAll this shows is how shameful sin is. Remember that all our iniquity was laid upon the Lord Jesus (Isaiah 53:6) and that He was numbered as a transgressor though He committed no sin (Isaiah 53:12). Having bore our sin, He also bore the shame that was due to it. He was put in an open shame and all who saw Him mocked Him and utterly despised Him. Another Messianic prophecy that was told is the following:\n\n> But I am a worm, and no man;\n> A reproach of men, and despised by the people.\n>\n> Psalms 22:6\n\nThe suffering Servant is the one who is speaking here. He said of Himself, \"I am a worm, and no man\". Do you know someone who is full of shame that his resolve is to call himself a worm, or no man? I know someone. His name is Jesus Christ. He was literally full of shame as He suffered. But this shame was not due to His own sin for He had no sin of His own. It was all due to our sin. The wickedness of our sins was made manifest as He suffered for our sake.\n\n## He was made sin, He was made curse\n\nThe suffering of the Lord Jesus revealed how wicked our sin is and how great and damning the punishment we deserve due to our sins. We can further understand the depth of His suffering as we survey the Scriptures - the things writtern concerning Himself. We know that He bore our sin so He was numbered as a transgressor. We also know that in bearing our sin, He ought to receive the due curses that we deserved. And He totally bore our sins and our curses. But there's more to it than that. Paul wrote:\n\n> For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.\n>\n> 2 Corinthians 5:21\n\nThe Lord Jesus was not only the bearer of our sins. The Father made Him who knew no sin _to be sin_ for us. Our sins were not only laid upon Him but that He became sin. Furthermore,\n\n> Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”)\n>\n> Galatians 3:13\n\nIt is quite clear from that text that the Lord Jesus Christ was not only our redeemer from the curse of the Law. In fact He did the redeeming by _becoming a curse_ for us. Yes, He was cursed but He also became a curse for us. He became sin and He became a curse for our sake. Now if we will go back to what He said of Himself in Psalm 22:6,\n\n> But I am a worm, and no man;\n> A reproach of men, and despised by the people.\n>\n> Psalms 22:6\n\nOr in what Isaiah spoke concerning Him:\n\n> For he grew up before him like a young plant,\n> and like a root out of dry ground;\n> he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,\n> and no beauty that we should desire him.\n>\n> Isaiah 53:2\n\nWe will surely understand why He became someone of no beauty nor majesty. He became someone who is not desirable but only worthy of reproach. He had no beauty as He suffered for He became sin which had no beauty in it. He became undesirable for He became a curse which is never desirable. Everything that He has become as the suffering Servant was due to our sinfulness.\n\n## Despised the Shame for the Joy set before Him\n\nBut you know what? He did all these things willingly to save us from all our sin and shame. The author of Hebrews exhorts us:\n\n> looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n> Hebrews 12:2\n\nAs He was being put to open shame, there was a joy set before Him. I believe He could see us, for whom He suffered, finally free from shame and enjoying once again the presence of God just like in the Garden of Eden. We are the joy that was set before Him. We are the reason why endured the cross and despised its shame to the glory of God. It is the Lord's will to redeem us from sin and shame for we are created for His own glory and we ought to glorify Him by enjoying Him forever.\n\n## No more hiding, just enjoying\n\nThe result of sin is shame and this caused man to fearfully hide from God and to cover his own nakedness. It is for this reason that man lost his privilege to unashamedly enjoy God's presence that he turned to other things which are so much less glorious. But now because of the Lord Jesus Christ who suffered shame for our sake as He bore our sin and became sin, and as He redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for us, we are now free from shame by faith in Him. Thus, there is no more veil, walls, or any chasm that can hinder us from making much of Him. Having been redeemed and truly set free from shame, we ought to hide no more from Him but to boldly approach His throne (Hebrews 4:16) with confidence knowing that our nakedness is now covered by the very righteousness of Christ.\n\nBeloved, no more hiding, just enjoying Him by making much of Him for you and I are freed from sin and shame.\n",
