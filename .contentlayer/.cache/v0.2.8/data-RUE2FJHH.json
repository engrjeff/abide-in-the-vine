It includes the predetermined plan of God to save His chosen people from sin through the person and work of His Son Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches many things but its central message is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. While there are many essential doctrines of the Christian faith, the gospel lands at the pinnacle. We will not be able to fully grasp the depths of this glorious gospel but we will do well if we will resolve to at least consider what has been revealed in the Scriptures concerning this message. The following is a short summary of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n## The Character of God\n\n<BannerImage\n  src='https://res.cloudinary.com/abide-in-the-vine/image/upload/v1645711977/2_19ea27e392.png'\n  alt='the gospel of Jesus Christ - Abide in the Vine'\n/>\n\nThe gospel begins with who God is. You see, man's sin won't be a problem if God is not holy and just - but God is indeed holy and just. A closer look at the character of God will give us an idea about how perfect He is and how sinful we are.\n\n### **God is Holy**\n\nThe angels around the throne of God cry out to one another,\n\n> Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts;\n> The whole earth is full of His glory! -**Isaiah 6:3**\n\nGod is holy. It means that He is set apart from His creation in terms of nature. His nature is transcendent which means that He belongs to an entirely different category. There is none like Him (Isa. 46:9, Jer. 10:7, Psa. 86:8). He is completely other. He is separated from sin and He does not sin or participates with sin.\n\n### **God is Just**\n\nThe Psalmist wrote,\n\n> God is a just judge,\n> And God is angry with the wicked every day.\n> --**Psalms 7:11**\n\nGod is just and His justice demands that the guilty be punished. He will by no means clear the guilty (Exo. 34:7). Being a just Judge, God will bestow the due punishment to the sinners. He does not just let go of any sinner for that will make Him a terrible and unjust Judge.\n\nFurthermore, since God is holy that He really hates wickedness and since He is just, He is angry with the wicked everyday. Paul himself said that we were like \"children of wrath just like the others (Eph. 2:3)\" and Jesus our Lord Himsel said that \"he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him. (John 3:36)”. Notice that God is not only angry at sin but also at the sinner that His wrath will abide on any sinner who does not believe in His Son.\n\n## The Depravity of Man\n\n<BannerImage\n  src='https://res.cloudinary.com/abide-in-the-vine/image/upload/v1645711977/3_465cbacba1.png'\n  alt='the gospel of Jesus Christ - Abide in the Vine'\n/>\n\nMan's sinfulness is so radical. His inherent sinfulness makes him spiritually bankrupt. The Bible teaches the following:\n\n> There is none righteous, no, not one;\n> There is none who understands;\n> There is none who seeks after God.\n> There is none who understands;\n> There is none who seeks after God.\n> They have all turned aside;\n> They have together become unprofitable;\n> There is none who does good, no, not one.\n> --**Romans 3:10-12**\n\nIn another place Paul wrote,\n\n> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\n> --**Romans 3:23**\n\nIt is for this reason that man cannot save himself. Man's sin problem is not just something like the drowning of a man in an ocean which can be helped with a lifeboat. Man's sin problem is about being spiritually dead that he needs is life and resurrection. In addition to that, we need to realize that man's sinfulness goes beyond his actions - it is his nature. He is a sinner not because he sins but he sins because he is a sinner.\n\nMoreover, man's sin problem is so radical that he cannot respond to God's glory. He does not see God's infinite worth and utter beauty. He is so inclined to sin that even though it ensalves him, it is still his pursuit. Truly, the Lord is right when He said, \"men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil (John 3:19)\".\n\n> Man is so inclined to sin that even though it ensalves him, it is still his pursuit.\n\nYou may think that you are good person. But the standard is God and not your neighbor. Before God, all men are guilty. We cannot buy our way to heaven. We are not enough and we will never be enough. None of our so-called \"good works\" can ever make us right with God. It is written,\n\n> But we are all like an unclean thing,\n> And all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags;\n> We all fade as a leaf,\n> And our iniquities, like the wind,\n> Have taken us away.\n> --**Isaiah 64:6**\n\nNow, we have established that God is holy and just and that man is indeed sinful. The question now is,\n\n> How can a sinful man who deserves eternal damnation in hell be reconciled to the the just and holy God whose justice demands that the guilty be punished?\n\n## Jesus Christ, The Savior\n\n<BannerImage\n  src='https://res.cloudinary.com/abide-in-the-vine/image/upload/v1645711978/4_52dec3fcef.png'\n  alt='the gospel of Jesus Christ - Abide in the Vine'\n/>\n\nRemember the question that needs an answer:\n\n> How can a sinful man who deserves eternal damnation in hell be reconciled to the the just and holy God whose justice demands that the guilty be punished?\n\nThe answer is found in the person and works of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible clearly teaches why Jesus came into the world. Before He was born, an angel told Joseph,\n\n> And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.\n> --**Matthew 1:21**\n\nSo, not only does Jesus' name mean \"savior\", He really came to save His people from their sins. He came to seek and to save that which was lost (Luke 19:10). He came to give His life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28).\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of God who took upon Himself a form of a bondservant. He is the Word from the beginning that was made flesh (John 1:1,14). He is the Messiah or the Christ who was testified by the Law and the Prophets. Jesus is the one who,\n\n> being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.\n> --**Philippians 2:6-8**\n\n### Why did Jesus die?\n\nJesus died on the cross not for His own sin for He has no sin of His own (2 Cor. 5:21, Heb. 4:15). He lived a perfect life. He has the sinless perfection. And yet He suffered at the cross. Why? let us see the answer as prophesied by Isaiah,\n\n> All we like sheep have gone astray;\n> We have turned, every one, to his own way;\n> And the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.\n> --**Isaiah 53:6**\n\n> Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise Him;\n> He has put Him to grief.\n> When You make His soul an offering for sin,\n> He has put Him to grief.\n> When You make His soul an offering for sin,\n> --**Isaiah 53:10**\n\nFurthermore, Paul wrote:\n\n> whom [Jesus] God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed,\n> --**Romans 3:25**\n\nHere it is:\n\nJesus died because He bore our sins and He took upon Himself the punishment that we deserve. Because of that, God's wrath fell upon Him. He became a curse at the cross (Gal. 3:13). He paid fully the price that we can never pay. His life is indeed the ransom, the price of our redemption. Christ is the propitiation - the sacrifice that removed God's wrath and satisified His justice while at the same time upholding His holiness.\n\nAt the cross, the justice and the love of God met. The Bible teaches that,\n\n> But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\n> --**Romans 5:8**\n\nYou see, Christ did not wait for us to be good enough before He would die for us. While we were still sinners, He died for us and it is in this magnificent act of redemption that God's love was magnified while His justice is satisfied. Now, God is truly just and that He is the Justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus (Rom. 3:26).\n\nChrist Himself is the Gospel. He is the way to the Father (John 14:6). No other name was given to us by whom we can be saved (Acts 4:12). He alone is the Way. He alone is sufficient and powerful to save. Yes, Christ alone.\n\nNow, how should we respind to this glorious truth?\n\n## Man's Response\n\n<BannerImage\n  src='https://res.cloudinary.com/abide-in-the-vine/image/upload/v1645711977/5_084accb878.png'\n  alt='the gospel of Jesus Christ - Abide in the Vine'\n/>\n\nWhen a person hears the gospel, the Spirit of God will surely work in his or her heart. While the preacher shouts the external call, the Spirit of God does the effectual call in the heart of the hearer.\n\nSo then, a person can respond to the gospel call because it is the Spirit of God who does His irresistible work in him. Given this reality, what should be man's response to the gospel message?\n\n### Repentance and Faith\n\n> Repent, and believe in the gospel.\n> --**Mark 1:15**\n\nRepentance is a change of mind which results in turning from sins towards God. To repent also means to acknowledge that our works cannot save us, that only Christ can save us. On the other hand, faith in Christ means trusting Him for what He has done. It is also by faith that we receive the gift of salvation. The Bible teaches,\n\n> For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.\n> --**Ephesians 2:8-9**\n\nSalvation is a gift to be received by faith. It can never be achieved by good works or by joining a certain religious sect. It is only by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.\n\n### New Creation in Christ\n\nTo conclude this Gospel section, the Scriptures remind us that being in Christ means having life in Him and living for Him. We are now a new creation in Christ and now we ought to love solely for Him.\n\n> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.\n> --**2 Corinthians 5:17**\n",

          "raw": "\nKey Text: Jeremiah 2–3\n\nWe live in a time where there are lots of things around us that are designed in order to attempt to satisfy the needs of men. These things are being fed to us on a daily basis. In this world of self and instant gratification, we see the big role that the media plays. The media shows us what our flesh desires and creates in us a craving for more entertainment — a means which can never get through the depths of the heart. The social media is flooded with contents which aim to inspire, motivate, and push us to be better or to pursue self-advancement. While there is some good in that, we know for sure that such things can still leave us lifeless and unsatisfied. The default of men today is to turn to the world for satisfaction even though they know already that a vanity piled on top of another vanity will just end up in vanity.\n\n> The default of men today is to turn to the world for satisfaction even though they know already that a vanity piled on top of another vanity will just end up in vanity.\n\nThere’s one more thing that I believe is more dangerous than turning to the world for satisfaction. This is being self-centered. We live in a time where people want to live autonomously, that is, self-government. Man considers himself as the owner of his life and so resolves to rule it by his own according to his desires. Man considers his faculties including his intellect and emotions to be the only source of reason and that the universe is about himself and that he or she should always be understood by everyone. It is evident these days that men have become lovers of themselves (2 Timothy 3:2) so they create a god in their own mind which is in fact is themselves. They have an image of a god in their mind and heart and yes, that is not the God of the Scriptures.\n\nWhat is happening now to people also happened to the Israelites of old. The Israelites turned to their own ways and had forsaken the Lord their God who delivered them with great power from Egypt. The Lord, as He told Jeremiah the Prophet, recalls what Israel was once:\n\n> The word of the LORD came to me, saying,\n> “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD,\n> “I remember the devotion of your youth,\n> your love as a bride,\n> how you followed me in the wilderness,\n> in a land not sown.\n> Israel was holy to the LORD,\n> the firstfruits of his harvest…\n> **(Jeremiah 2:1–3)**\n\nIsrael was indeed precious before the Lord. However, the Lord states the unfortunate turning away of His people:\n\n> 5 Thus says the LORD:\n> “What wrong did your fathers find in me\n> that they went far from me,\n> “What wrong did your fathers find in me\n> that they went far from me,\n> and went after worthlessness, and became worthless?\n> 6 They did not say, Where is the LORD\n> who brought us up from the land of Egypt,\n> who led us in the wilderness,\n> in a land of deserts and pits,\n> in a land of drought and deep darkness,\n> in a land that none passes through,\n> where no man dwells?’\n> 7 And I brought you into a plentiful land\n> to enjoy its fruits and its good things.\n> But when you came in, you defiled my land\n> and made my heritage an abomination.\n> 8 The priests did not say, ‘Where is the LORD?’\n> Those who handle the law did not know me;\n> the shepherds transgressed against me;\n> the prophets prophesied by Baal\n> and went after things that do not profit.\n> **(Jeremiah 2:5–8)**\n\nLet us see what the Israel had done in those days:\nThey went far from the Lord to pursue worthless things. They did not remember how the Lord delivered them from Egypt. They defiled the land in which the Lord brought them. The priests who were supposed to be reminding them of the law of God did not know the law themselves. The prophets prophesied falsely by Baal. They went to other things that do not profit. This is the Lord’s summary of what they did:\n\n> You have played the whore with many lovers\n> **(Jeremiah 3:1)**\n\nThe Israel became so idolatrous that they had utterly forgotten and forsaken the Lord their God. Oh, Christian! can you relate to this? Have you been like the Israel of old? Have you also forsaken the Lord your God? They loved other things more than they loved the Lord.\nWe may not be aware of it but we are most oftentimes like the Israelites. We raise our hands in worship every Lord’s day and yet we turn to the passing glory of the world as our nourishment for the rest of the week. The Lord is right when He said:\n\n> for My people have committed two evils:\n> they have forsaken Me,\n> the fountain of living waters,\n> they have forsaken Me,\n> the fountain of living waters,\n> and hewn out cisterns for themselves,\n> broken cisterns that can hold no water.\n> **(Jeremiah 2:13)**\n\nNote the two evils we have committed:\n\n1. We have forsaken the Lord;\n2. We made for ourselves cisterns which can hold no water.\n\nWe express through our worship songs that the Lord is the fountain that won’t run dry. But when was the last time we come to Him for a drink of living water? What we always do is that we take the road back to Egypt and drink its bitter waters. We, as Christians, are not ignorant that God is there but we always exercise negligence of Him and in so doing we willfully forsake Him for the sake of the unprofitable things of the world. We love the bitter waters of the world which unknowingly poisons us and drains the life out of us. We forget that life is only found in the Lord and that anything outside of Jesus Christ is a total absurdity. We are not even ashamed that we no longer have the desire to _“taste and see that the Lord is good (Psalm 34:8)”_. When was the last time that we are one with the Psalmist when he said:\n\n> As a deer pants for flowing streams,\n> so pants my soul for You, O God.\n> My soul thirsts for God,\n> for the living God.\n> When shall I come and appear before God?\n> **(Psalm 42:1–2)**\n\nChristian, is there a thirst in you now? Do you long for Him? Is there some craving, longing, and desire for Him somewhere in your heart? Don’t commit the mistake or don’t continue the mistake of thinking that the vanities of this world can ever satisfy that thirst.\nWe hewn for ourselves cisterns which can hold no water. We know that a cistern is a large reservoir of water or any liquid. But when it comes to the satisfaction of the weary and thirsty soul, no size of cistern can ever fill it. No matter how large, it will always look broken thus it can never hold a water that satisfies. You see, no matter what things we make as our own means of finding joy — whether it is our hobbies, work, studies, endless TV series, gratification in social media, approval and appraise of men, and even relationships and our church ministries — we will never be joyful with joy that lasts. The reason for this is that it is only that in God’s presence the fullness of joy is found and satisfying pleasures are in Him alone (Psalm 16:11).\n\nWe oftentimes mock those who built an altar for themselves to put therein a god of their own imagination, crafted by hands. But have we come to realize that we may not have bowed down to idols made with hands but we have surely bowed down to idols made by our hearts? It is not whether we bow to tangible things or not — it is a matter of what really our desire is and where do our affections go. We have gone a long way from the Lord and like the prodigal son we have been wasting our lives playing the harlot and eating with pigs.\n\nIt is true that we have resolved to turn away from the Lord but there is still hope. We may be bombarded by lots of thoughts of confusion right now since we are lost in the wilderness but there is still hope. We can only hope to God’s sovereign will in order for us to be brought back to His fold. Here’s the Lord’s resolve after He stated His case against Israel:\n\n> But you have played the harlot with many lovers;\n> Yet return to Me,” says the LORD.\n> **(Jeremiah 3:1)**\n\nThe Lord will surely confront us and will tell us that we have sinned against Him. Our sin against Him is so serious that it is not just a silly mistake but a willful rebellion and an offence against Him. He clearly told Israel that they indeed played the harlot and this confrontation must have broken Israel’s heart to pieces. But the Lord, in His sovereignty, chose to respond to their idolatry with tender mercies. The Lord lovingly says, **“Yet return to Me.”**.\n\nThe same call is being spoken by the Lord to us right now. While we are backsliding, He is constantly calling us to return to Him. “How does He call us?”, one might ask. Well, aside from the sure presence of conviction of the Spirit of God in you right now, He has given you life today. This is God’s call for you:\n\n> **Return**, O backsliding children,” says the LORD;\n> “for I am married to you.\n> I will take you,\n> one from a city and two from a family,\n> and I will bring you to Zion.\n> **(Jeremiah 3:14)**\n\nThe Lord said that He will take us to Himself for He is married to us. We are the church — the Lord’s bride and yet we, in our fragility, still play the harlot. But the Lord’s faithfulness is so great that it does not fail. He still considers Himself married to us. This is indeed a wonderful depiction of God’s love for His people. The call of the Lord is an effectual call that it is the only call that can turn the heart of stone into a heart of flesh. Surely, this loving call from our Good Shepherd will break our hearts that we will repent and acknowledge our iniquity before Him.\n\nReturn to Him. You may have left the Lord but He has never left you. The prodigal son left his father and wasted his life but when he came to his senses, he decided to go back to his father and when he returned, he found his father with great affection of love and with forgiveness in his eyes running towards him. Return to Him. Return to Him.\n\nLike the Prophet Jeremiah, may this be our resolve everyday:\n\n> 22 Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed,\n> Because His compassions fail not.\n> 23 They are new every morning;\n> Because His compassions fail not.\n> 23 They are new every morning;\n> Great is Your faithfulness.\n> 24 “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul,\n> “Therefore I hope in Him!”\n> **(Lamentations 3:22–24)**\n\nIn this world, He is our portion which means that He is all we have. Yes, He is all we need but as one preacher always says, He is all we have. Therefore hope in Him alone. Do not trust yourself. As much as you don’t trust yourself for your salvation, don’t also trust yourself or anything else for your satisfaction.\n\nThe Lord is faithful. He saved you, so He will satisfy you. He justified you so He will surely sanctify you. Let us be one with the Apostle Paul in his resolve:\n\n> And I am sure of this, that He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.\n> **(Philippians 1:6)**\n",

          "raw": "\nAs a believer of Christ, we are often told to read the Scriptures. Some say we have to read it because it is a “**B**asic **I**nstruction **B**efore **L**eaving **E**arth (Bible)”. Some say that in it we can discover what we have to do throughout the day for different circumstances. Many say it is just a collection of history books with many contradictions amongst each other. People use the passages of the Scriptures to somehow give them some motivational fuel to continue living and to pursue their own dreams. For some, it is simply a manual for life written by men of old.\n\nMany Christians nowadays just open the Book of books in search for guidance for their business, new ventures, whether they should enter through the newly opened door of opportunities, whether they have to get into relationships, and the likes of it. They just turn at the last pages of the Bible and look for the outlined subjects such as healing, wealth, and prayer and then look for relevant passages and upon reading so will make them feel good. While it is undeniable that the Scriptures can be of great help for such things, are those really the essence of the Holy Book? Is it really about us? Is it just a bunch of stories intended for us to be motivated at all times and feel good about ourselves? Are we missing the point, the big picture?\n\nLet us dive into the Scriptures itself and try to understand what it is really all about. In Luke 24:27, it is written:\n\n> “And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things **concerning Himsel**f.”\n\nThe narrative behind that passage is that there were two people talking on the road to Emmaus about the recent events concerning Jesus of Nazareth. While they conversed and reasoned together, the Lord Himself drew near to them. It is quite clear in the passage above that the Scriptures is about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Savior of the world, and the Lord of all. But what does it mean when it is apparent that the people in the Old Testament were not Him?\n\nHere it is. While the events told in the Scriptures do not directly concern Him, all of those point to Him. Let’s dive even deeper and begin at the very first book of the Bible which is Genesis. In Genesis 3:15,\n\n> “And I will put enmity\n> Between you and the woman,\n> And between your seed and her Seed;\n> He shall bruise your head,\n> And you shall bruise His heel.”\n\nAfter the Fall of Man, God said something about “her Seed”. This was the start of the greatest story that is about to unfold through the pages of the Scriptures. The Scriptures is about that Seed. The mind of God is so focused on that “Seed” that He would call men to be players in the scene that He Himself has set into motion. For example in the life of Abraham and Sarah, God called Abraham, promised him that he would have a child from Sarah who was barren that time. The couple had their moments of doubts but God’s promise was fulfilled and Isaac came. Isaac then begat Jacob (Israel) from whom the twelve tribes came out.\n\nLet’s enter the time during the Law and the Prophets._ “Beginning at Moses and all the Prophets”_ implies all of the Old Testament which is the Scriptures itself. From Moses to all the Prophets we can see that the Lord Jesus Christ is concealed beneath many things. The Tabernacle and the Feasts were all about Him. The Law was given through Moses (John 1:17) and the children of Israel tried to obey it by their own strength. But when Jesus taught in the Sermon of the Mount, we have seen that we cannot obey the Law perfectly. The righteousness that God requires is simply unattainable by us. We can see now that we need a better Law keeper. Given the Law, the people of God were still stiff-necked so they asked for Judges to lead them. But it is clear that the Judges who were established by God were simply not enough to keep them from the coming captivity or to tame their wickedness. They had asked then for a king and God somehow allowed their request. So Saul, a tall man, became their king. From Saul to David up to the kings who succeeded them, we see a mix of righteous and wicked men who could not make Israel totally abandon their idols. Until the days of Prophets came when they were oftentimes alone and despised, always in lamentations and great grief over the sins of the chosen nation Israel.\n\nFrom Moses to the Prophets, it is evident that no man is ever enough. No man can tame a wicked heart. But one thing is for sure, the Law (Moses) and the Prophets all point to Christ! Every story and event in the Bible are intricately set in its right time and place with the right role players in order to point us to the Main and Only Hero — the Lord Jesus Christ!\n\n> Every story and event in the Bible are intricately set in its right time and place with the right role players in order to point us to the Main and Only Hero — the Lord Jesus Christ!\n\nJesus Christ is the essence of the Scriptures. We need a better Law keeper, so He kept and fulfilled the Law completely. We need a better sacrifice, so He was the Lamb without blemish righteous enough to atone for the sins of many. He is the propitiation for the sins of the world who was fit to absorb the holy wrath of God. We need a better High Priest, so after His ascension, He has sat down at the right hand of the Father. We need a better Judge, so He came. We need a better King, so He came. We need more than just the Presence in the Tabernacle so He dwelt with us in the flesh (John 1:14). We need more than a prophet so He came. We need a savior, so He came. He was indeed the point of the Law and the Prophets. Philip exclaimed to Nathanael,\n\n> Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “**We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote — Jesus of Nazareth**, the son of Joseph.”\n> **-John 1:45**\n\n> The Lord Jesus Christ is the righteousness of God **being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets** > **-Romans 3:21**.\n\nThe Apostle Paul passionately expounded about the Lord as told in the following text:\n\n> “So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, **persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets**, from morning till evening. ”\n> **-Acts 28:23**\n\nThe Apostle Philip explained to a Eunuch who was reading the book of Prophet Isaiah:\n\n> “Then Philip opened his mouth, **and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him**. ”\n> **-Acts 8:35**\n\nLook at that highlighted portion of the text! The writings of Isaiah points to Christ Himself! It is now compelling to note that the whole Scriptures truly testifies about Christ!\n\nThe whole Gospel of John was written for us to believe in Jesus Christ.\n\n> “but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name. ”\n> **-John 20:31**\n\nThe Book of Acts was about the proclamation of Christ and Him crucified— His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension!\n\nThe Epistles were written to explain Him, not us! The Revelation is about His coming!\n\nBeloved, the Christian life is never about us. Don’t just open the Bible for your sake. While it can really help you in your daily life, I’m afraid that you might miss the point, the grand design which God Himself has orchestrated. Stop treating the Word of God as a mere self-help book for in doing so you are just actually using it as an addition to your life and not your life. Refrain from infusing yourself into the story of the Bible like you’re the hero and the center of the universe. Christ may be preeminent in your life that when you open and read your Bible, your desire will be nothing but “to know Him and Him crucified (1 Cor. 2:2)”. Understand that Jesus Christ is the greater Moses, Joshua, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and David. The central point of the Scriptures is the Son of God to whom we hope and to whose finished works we boast. When you understand in your heart that the whole Bible is never about you but about Him, you will surely dive into it with joy and excitement.\n\nIt is not fitting to say that our lives is about Him and yet we see ourselves as the “entitled” hero of many biblical narratives. Furthermore, you cannot see Christ if you are so filled with yourselves. Many say that they are not saved by works and yet they are always preoccupied with themselves. Ask the Spirit of God who dwells in you that He will empty you of yourself along with your narcissistic desires, that He will help you unlearn things which you have read or heard before, that He will do His illuminating work in your heart as He points you to the Son.\n",

Prior to knowing Christ, the heart of a man is like a void and it is in utter darkness. We were “once darkness (Eph. 5:8)”, we were “under the power of darkness (Col. 1:13)”, our hearts were darkened (Rom. 1:21, Eph. 4:18). We “loved darkness rather than the light (John 3:19)” and our deeds were evil.\n\nHow dark was that darkness? As dark as without the light of God or without God Himself (Eph. 2:12). Imagine living even just for a day without the sun and its light. Too dark? Now imagine being without the light of the One who gives and sustains the sun’s light. That’s utter darkness, a great divide. Being in the dark implies many things and that involves being alienated from the life of God (Eph. 4:18). That also involves having sin as our prison, and at the same time our pursuit. Imagine pursuing with passion that which enslaves you. That’s indeed a bondage.\n\nOur hearts were dark enough that it could not perceive the glory of God. So dark that we are compelled to exchange the glory of God to anything that is so much less than Him. This was our depraved state before we heard the gospel of Christ.\n\nBut the Lord is gracious indeed. He knows that man cannot lit a light in his darkened heart. So what we could not and would not do, He did. As He commanded the light out of darkness, He shone Himself in our hearts — yes, not just His light but also Himself. This is what happened in the New Birth. The dead heart which was stone-cold towards God was awakened to the knowledge of God.\n\nA darkened heart corresponds to spiritual deadness and blindness while being enlightened by God means being alive to Him and being able to see and savor Him. God shines in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of His glory in the face of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, God’s greatest revelation is His Son. He is most revealed through His Son. He is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15), the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person (Heb. 1:3). The Lord Jesus Himself said, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father (John 14:9)”.\n\nSince God Himself reveals Himself to us through His Son by the gospel, a person who is truly born again or enlightened or awakened by Him will surely desire Him and will delight in Him. Once he loved darkness but now his heart’s inclination is toward His beautiful Savior and he will surely spend his days knowing Him, making much of Him, and making Him known to those who are still in darkness.\n",

          "raw": "\nKey Text: Job 9:2\n\nThe world is full of mysteries and many questions arise in the human mind concerning a lot of things. But not all questions need a concrete answer. There are questions that just don’t make sense or don’t matter at all. However, there are questions of which the required answer is a matter of life and death, heaven or hell. If such important questions won’t be given a definite answer, a man’s life will hang in a balance and uncertainty will fill his mind and heart, and the unknown will govern his life.\n\nOne such question is found in the Scriptures. It was asked by Job who suffered the loss of all that he had. But it was through his suffering that he was able to ponder upon this question:\n\n> But how can a man be righteous before God?\n> **--Job 9:2**\n\n##### **Repent!?**\n\nJob was prompted to ask that question when one of his friends told him essentially that he should repent. Job had three visiting friends who “made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him (Job 2:11)”. These three friends of Job were Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite.\n\nBildad told Job,\n\n> **If you would earnestly seek God**\n> And make your supplication to the Almighty,\n> **If you were pure and upright**,\n> Surely now He would awake for you,\n> And prosper your rightful dwelling place.\n> **--Job 8:5–6**\n\nMoreover he said,\n\n> Behold, God will not cast away the blameless,\n> Nor will He uphold the evildoers.\n> **--Job 8:20**\n\nBildad’s advise to Job was not bad at all. In fact, he was right. His point was that Job should repent or be made right with God for He deals favorably with the righteous but never upholds the evildoers. However, Job was still perplexed and to his friend he replied:\n\n> Truly I know it is so,\n> **But how can a man be righteous before God?**\n> **--Job 9:2**\n\n##### **Understanding who God is**\n\nJob then continued and talked about the sovereignty of God, His power over all, and that He does great things. Among the things which he said, there are deep things about the nature of God which he realized. The following are so:\n\n> **God will not withdraw His anger**,\n> The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him.\n> How then can I answer Him,\n> And choose my words to reason with Him?\n> For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him;\n> **I would beg mercy of my Judge**.\n> **--Job 9:13–15**\n\nWhat can we learn about God from Job’s realizations? We see here the reality of God’s wrath. _“God will not withdraw His anger”_, Job said. We also see here the reality of God’s justice: _“For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge”_. Job acknowledged that God does not just forget and forgive. His wrath towards sin and the sinners is real and His justice demands that the guilty be punished.\n\nMoreover, there is a striking conclusion that Job uttered. Look at this:\n\n> It is all one thing;\n> Therefore I say, **He destroys the blameless and the wicked**.’\n> **--Job 9:22**\n\nGod destroys the blameless and the wicked. Isn’t it surprising? For sure we are not surprised that the wicked will surely be destroyed. But the blameless? How can Job say that? For Job knew and we ought to know as well that no one is really blameless before God on his own. Job even said about himself:\n\n> I am blameless, yet I do not know myself;\n> I despise my life.\n> **--Job 9:21**\n\nJob said he was blameless while at the same time he didn’t know himself. The point is that like Job, we could be righteous in our own eyes or when we compare ourselves with others. But in reality, “all our righteousness are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6)”. In life, we ought to know two kinds of knowledge: the knowledge of God and the knowledge of self. A right understanding of who God is — His nature, His attributes, His works, and His will will surely make us understand who we are in the most deepest sense. It is when we truly know God that we will be crushed by the reality of our sinfulness and this compels us to cry out for mercy.\n\nNow, knowing who God is and having an understanding that God destroys the self-righteous and the wicked, Job said:\n\n> If I wash myself with snow water,\n> And cleanse my hands with soap,\n> Yet You will plunge me into the pit,\n> And my own clothes will abhor me.\n> **--Job 9:30–31**\n\nJob knew that every effort to cleanse himself will be in vain. No amount of pure water can wash a sinful man clean. No amount of soap can ever whiten a sin-tainted, sin-filled heart. Job also understood that God is holy, that He is not like a man:\n\n> For He is not a man, as I am,\n> That I may answer Him,\n> And that we should go to court together.\n> Nor is there any mediator between us,\n> Who may lay his hand on us both.\n> **--Job 9:32–33**\n\n_“For He is not a man, as I am”_. That statement implies that Job understood that God is indeed transcendent, that He is completely other, that He is totally separate from His creation when it comes to nature, that He is indeed holy. Given these in-depth realizations of Job, he knew that if ever he desires to be right with God, there has to be a mediator between them who may lay his hand on both of them.\n\nSo Job was in utter distress because of his suffering and having realized who God is, guilt and condemnation were added to his agony. In understanding who God is, he also got to know that his greatest malady was not his sufferings but that he could not be right with God on and by his own for he was helpless to save himself.\n\n##### **We have the same malady**\n\nNow, don’t we have the same malady as that of Job’s? The Scripture testifies that no one is righteous, not even one (Rom. 3:10), no one does good (Rom. 3:12), all have sinned and have fallen short of God’s glory (Rom. 3:23), and that the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23), and that the soul who sins shall die (Ezek. 18:4), and that all are guilty before God (Rom. 3:20).\n\nGiven that we have the same malady as Job, we ought to also ask the same question:\n\n> How can I be right with God?\n\n##### **The Remedy to the Malady**\n\nSo, how can a man be right with God? First, let us remember that God is just and His justice should be satisfied, that God is holy and His holiness should never be compromised, that He is wrathful towards the wicked and their sins so His abiding wrath should be removed if any man should be right with Him.\n\nSecondly, we have to understand what it means to be right with God. To be right with Him means, as the Lord Jesus said, “you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect (Matthew 5:48)”. The righteousness that God requires is utter perfection. This righteousness is His own righteousness. He only accepts His own righteousness for any other form of righteousness is just a filthy rag before Him. So then, this righteousness is not found in us but in Him alone. Seeking this righteousness in us or in others is a quest that just ends in vanity — it’s fruitless, lifeless, futile indeed. Thus, only God can give us the righteousness that He Himself requires in order for any man to be right with Him.\n\nAnd now, how can you and I be right God? The answer is in the following passage:\n\n> But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,\n> even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference;\n> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\n> being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed,\n> to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.\n> **--Romans 3:21–26**\n\nSo the answer is found in the person and work of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the very righteousness of God given to man by whom we can be saved. It is through faith in Him, that is, trusting Him for what He did for us, that we can receive this righteousness. But how did this happen? How did Christ’s sacrifice pave the way for our salvation?\n\nHere it is: Christ was put forward by God as a propitiation by His blood. A propitiation is simply a sacrifice that removes wrath. At the cross, Christ became cursed and curse (Gal. 3:13–14), He became sin though He knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21a) because _“the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all\n(Isaiah 53:6)”_. He became an offering for sin (Isaiah 53:10) for He is God’s Righteous Servant who* “shall justify many, For He shall bear their iniquities. (Isaiah 53:11)”*. The Lord Jesus’ sacrifice at the cross satisfied the justice of God, upheld His holiness, and removed His holy wrath. That’s how He secured the salvation of many. God sent His Son to save sinners an He condemned sin in His flesh _“that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us (Romans 8:4)”_. God made Jesus the offering for our sins that we might become His righteousness in Him (2 Cor. 5:21).\n\nNow, let us go back to Job’s problem (and ours as well):\n\n> Nor is there any mediator between us,\n> Who may lay his hand on us both.\n> **--Job 9:33**\n\nGod Himself provided us the Mediator in order for us who are sinners to be reconciled with Him who is holy. Jesus Christ is now the Mediator between God and Man. Paul wrote:\n\n> For there is one God and **one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus**, who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time,\n> **--1 Timothy 2:5–6**\n\nThe Son of God took the form of a bondservant and was obedient up to the point of His death at the cross (Phil. 2:7–8) in order that He might reconcile us to the Father. That’s how He stood in the gap between the holy God and sinful men. Until today, His mediating work continues as He sits at the right hand of the Father in His high priestly office making intercession for us (Rom. 8:34).\n\nThus, our justification, that is, God declaring us righteous before Him, is because of Jesus Christ. We are “justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ”. Christ became our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30) and we are God’s righteousness in Him (2 Cor. 5:21b). We receive this righteousness by faith alone in Christ alone, it is not something that we should attempt to achieve.

          "raw": "\nIt is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John that the Lord Jesus Christ uses different imageries or word pictures to tell people about who He is. In John 6 we find the Lord claiming to be the Bread of Life (John 6:35). Later in John 8 we find the Lord to be the Light of the world (John 8:12). Before speaking about Him being the Good Shepherd, He spoke of Himself as the Door of the sheep (John 10:7). Then later in verse 11 of the 10th chapter of John’s gospel, we find that the Lord claims to be the Good Shepherd.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ used the imagery of a shepherd during His discourse with the Jews. He used this imagery not only because shepherding is relatable for the Jews for it is a common occupation in Israel but more importantly because God is oftentimes portrayed as the shepherd of His people. God is the Shepherd of Israel and this truth is apparent in the Old Testament writings:\n\n> The LORD is my shepherd;\n> I shall not want.\n> **(Psalms 23:1)**\n\n> Save Your people,\n> And bless Your inheritance;\n> Shepherd them also,\n> And bless Your inheritance;\n> Shepherd them also,\n> And bear them up forever.\n> **(Psalms 28:9)**\n\n> He will feed His flock like a shepherd;\n> He will gather the lambs with His arm,\n> And carry them in His bosom,\n> He will gather the lambs with His arm,\n> And carry them in His bosom,\n> And gently lead those who are with young.\n> **(Isaiah 40:11)**\n\n> For thus says the Lord GOD: “Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out. As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day.\"\n> **(Ezekiel 34:11–12)**\n\nNow, we see the Lord Jesus Christ speaking of Himself as the Good Shepherd.\n\n> **I am the good shepherd**. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.\n> **(John 10:11)**\n\nEssentially, the Lord Jesus Christ is saying that He is God. He is the God-Man. He is truly Man and truly God. He is not 50% Man and 50% God. He is both 100% Man and 100% God at the same time. He is the same God who spoke to Moses at the burning bush in Exodus 3. He is the one who said to Moses,\n“I AM WHO I AM…Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you. (Exodus 3:14)”.\n\n##### **The False Shepherds**\n\nJesus is contrasting Himself with the Jewish leaders whom He describes as thieves and robbers (John 10:1) and strangers (John 10:5). The Jewish leaders are the false shepherds during the time of Jesus. They bring with them the Mosaic Law mixed with their man-made traditions and doctrines thereby creating a false religion that serves as a heavy yoke for the Israelites. In Ezekiel 34, there’s a prophecy concerning the false shepherds of Israel:\n\n> And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD to the shepherds: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool; you slaughter the fatlings, but you do not feed the flock. The weak you have not strengthened, nor have you healed those who were sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back what was driven away, nor sought what was lost; but with force and cruelty you have ruled them. So, they were scattered because there was no shepherd; and they became food for all the beasts of the field when they were scattered. My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill; yes, My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and no one was seeking or searching for them.”\n> **(Ezekiel 34:1–6)**\n\nThe false shepherds are the irresponsible, self-centered, religionist, legalist, and traditionist leaders of Israel. The Lord is against such leaders.\n\n##### **Jesus Christ: The Good Shepherd**\n\nJesus Christ is the Good Shepherd of His own sheep. He is the One who was moved with compassion for the multitudes who were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd (Matt. 9:36). He is the one whose yoke is easy and whose burden is light from whom we can find rest (Matt. 11:28). He is the fulfillment of the prophecy in Ezekiel 34:\n\n> For thus says the Lord GOD: “Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out. As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day.\n> **(Ezekiel 34:11–12)**\n\nHe fulfilled this prophecy by becoming the incarnate Son of God who came here on earth “to seek and save that which was lost (Luke 19:10)”. He is the Good Shepherd who truly cares for His own sheep.\n\nNow, what does it mean for the Lord Jesus Christ to be the Good Shepherd? When we hear the sentence “the LORD is my Shepherd”, the famous Psalm 23 immediately comes to mind. Because of this, we think of comfort in Christ, how He cares for us, how He leads us. Those things are indeed true and worth-knowing. But there’s so much more to Christ being the Good Shepherd.\n\n##### **The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the Sheep**\n\n> I am the good shepherd. **The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep**…\n> **(John 10:11)**\n\nThe Lord Himself defines what it means for Him to be the Good Shepherd. It is plainly told by the Lord that the Good Shepherd gives His life for the sheep. Unlike a hireling who does not own the sheep and therefore has no care for the sheep, the Good Shepherd does not leave the sheep and does not flee for His own life. The good shepherd does not flee for His own life but rather gives His own life for the sheep. He is the _Shepherd Savior_:\n\n> Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd,\n> Against the Man who is My Companion,”\n> Says the LORD of hosts.\n> “Strike the Shepherd,\n> And the sheep will be scattered;\n> Then I will turn My hand against the little ones.\n> **(Zechariah 13:7)**\n\n> Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written:\n> I will strike the Shepherd,\n> And the sheep of the flock will be scattered.\"\n> **(Matthew 26:31)**\n\nChrist became the front liner. He was the one stricken while being left alone. While we are like sheep who have gone astray and turned to our own way, the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Isaiah 53:6). He took upon Himself the full weight of the sheep’s sins thus receiving the full weight of God’s holy wrath upon Himself at the cross. For this purpose, He came: “to give His life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28)”.\n\nThis is a deep demonstration of His love for His own sheep. Indeed, there is no greater love than what the Good Shepherd has demonstrated to us:\n\n> Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.\n> **(John 15:13)**\n\nAnd this is how we know what love really is:\n\n> By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\n> **(1 John 3:16)**\n\nHere we can see that the Lord’s love for His own sheep goes beyond His willingness to bless us with what we need. It is far-reaching that what He gave us is His own life — the life that had been lived in perfection. The Good Shepherd is good not only because He sought us but also because He saved us by dying on the cross for us.\n\n##### **The Good Shepherd knows His Own**\n\n> I am the good shepherd; and **I know My sheep**, and am known by My own.\n> **(John 10:14)**\n\nThe Good Shepherd knows His very own. He knows His own not only in the cognitive sense but also in the saving (salvific) sense. He knows them not because they lived in the past, living in the present, or will live in the future. He knows them because they are chosen in Him before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). He knows His own that He knows whom He must bring out of the fold of false religions and world systems. He knows His own that He is so certain who to seek in the wilderness. He knows His own so much that He can identify if someone is lost. His knowledge of His own is so important because these are the ones for whom He must die.\n\nThe Good Shepherd did not seek for random people. He sought for specific sheep which are His very own. Jesus Himself said that He came to “give His life as a ransom for many. (Matt. 20:28)”. The word “many” doesn’t imply “all”. The word “many” means a certain elect group of people and for this group alone He died. This group is collectively known as the “sheep” in this context.\n\nThe sheep are the ones whom the Father gives to Christ (John 6:37). These people will surely come to Christ because the Father will draw them to Him (John 6:44). The Lord Jesus Christ knows His own that when His sheep are gathered together with the goats, He knows how to divide the sheep from the goats (Matt. 25:32).\n\n##### **The Good Shepherd is known by His Own**\n\n> I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and **am known by My own**.\n> **(John 10:14)**\n\nThe sheep might be temporarily lost but they will surely be found by the Shepherd. By the effectual call of the Good Shepherd, they will surely respond for they know His voice. The sheep know their Shepherd’s voice because only Him knows their name and calls them by it (John 10:27). The sheep of the Lord Jesus Christ know His voice because His voice is unique and distinct from the stranger’s voice. When the Shepherd calls, only the sheep will respond because they are the only ones who are made able and willing to respond to that call.\n\nTo be known by the Lord and to be given the great privilege of knowing Him is such a great blessing indeed! The sheep then must be grateful that the Lord Jesus Christ, on the last day, will not tell them, “I never knew you” but will joyfully receive them to glory.\n\n##### **Conclusion**\n\nThe Good Shepherd is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the one who calls His own and is followed by His own. He willingly gave His life for His own sheep alone. He knows His own and is known by His own for to them He chose to reveal Himself.\n",

          "raw": "\nThe hour has come and the Lord Jesus Christ was about to be betrayed with a traitor’s kiss to be delivered to wicked men. It was that time that the Feast of the Passover was at hand so He and His disciples went to an upper room. There the Lord instituted the Lord’s Supper. There He ate with them. There He washed the disciples’ feet. There He gave them a new commandment to love one another. But there was also the place where His betrayer, Judas Iscariot, lifted up his heel against Him (John 13:18). It was after the traitor had left that Jesus spoke the following words:\n\n> Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come,’ so now I say to you.\n> **(John 13:33)**\n\nThis must be saddening for the disciples. Having been with the Lord during His earthly ministry, the Lord knew that they would be exceedingly troubled and their hearts would be filled with grief at the thought of His departure. But the Lord spoke to them words of assurance and comfort:\n\n> Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. And where I go you know, and the way you know.\n> **(John 14:1–4)**\n\nSorrow might fill their hearts but the Lord Jesus Christ spoke words of comfort to them. The Lord’s words are comforting because they gave the disciples solid hope on which they could really rely. The Lord’s words are marked with utmost sincerity, faithfulness, assurance, and love.\n\nNow, the Lord made it clear that He would go to the Father but somehow Thomas, or even perhaps most of them, was bewildered. He was confused that he asked the Lord, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way? (John 14:5)”. It was at this moment when the Lord uttered one of the most popular statements concerning Himself:\n\n> I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.\n> **(John 14:6)**\n\n##### **Jesus is the Way**\n\nThomas said that they did not know where the Lord was going and the way to get there. So Jesus said that He is the way and no one comes to the Father except through Him. Now, what does it mean for Jesus to be the way to the Father?\n\n**The way to be with the Father.** The most popular meaning is that He is indeed the way to heaven. He is the road or the pathway through which people must come in order to get to the Father. The Lord Jesus Christ is not a way, He is the way and any other way is no way at all. This truth about Christ is a hard blow to the philosophical notion of pluralism. Pluralism asserts that every religion is valid and everything can be regarded as truth. By that assertion alone, pluralism tries to put an end to truth by accepting all to be true. But in the Christian faith, Christ alone is the way to heaven. Christ alone is the means to get to the Father to be with Him forever.\n\nThe evangelical world today is infested with many ideas which contradict the biblical doctrine of Christ being the only way to heaven. Some professing Christian ministers deny this truth in an attempt to promote unity among the diverse religions but compromising what Jesus said about Himself for the sake of unity is a total negligence of truth. Jesus Christ is the narrow gate (Matthew 7:13) and without Him, no one can come to the Father and every one will be damned in hell for all eternity.\n\n**The way to know and see the Father.** The Lord Jesus followed His statement with this:\n\n> If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.\n> **(John 14:7)**\n\nBut Philip replied,\n\n> Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.”\n> **(John 14:8)**\n\nTo which the Lord replied,\n\n> Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?\n> **(John 14:9)**\n\nThe way to know the Father is knowing the Lord Jesus Christ. The way to see the Father is to behold the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is the ultimate revelation of the Father. He is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15), the brightness of the Father’s glory, and the express image of His person (Heb. 1:3). The glory that has been withheld to the Old Testament people such as Moses (Exo. 33:18, 20) was revealed through the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, it is quite fascinating to know that Christ is not only the way to heaven, He is also the way for us to know and see the Father. In fact, heaven itself is just a consolation prize, the knowledge of God Himself is the greatest reward for the elect of God.\n\n##### **Jesus is the Truth**\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is the very embodiment of truth. He is absolute truth. No lie can come forth from Him. This also proves His deity for God cannot lie (Titus 1:2) and since Jesus is truth, He is God. He is also the very source of truth. Every lie is a departure from the truth. So, if you want to live according to the truth, you must know Christ and abide in His teachings. He is the absolute aid to all sorts of confusion and deception caused by the devil.\n\n##### **Jesus is the Life**\n\nChrist not only gives and sustains life, He is life Himself. From His being springs life. In Him is life — not only biological life but also eternal life or the God-kind of life. There is no life outside of the Lord Jesus Christ. When we understand that Christ is life, we would surely stay with Him for the thought of being without Him must be horrifying. He is the essence of life and His elect are blessed indeed to be given the life that is in Him alone.\n",

          "raw": "\nLet me begin this post by reminding all of you that everything that is written in the Scriptures is truth. The biblical writers were not writing mere observations or just their own speculations. What they wrote is true and is indeed truth. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God (2 Timothy 3:16). Since God is truth and that He cannot lie, everything that is in His written word is truth.\n\nThe words of the Scriptures are tested and proven to be true. They have passed the test of time. They have brought even the most intellectual critics to their knees. They have even put to shame many skeptics which paved the way for them to turn to the Lord. Countless prophecies have already come to pass and many more are yet to unfold. Thus, there is no other book which can perfectly assess man except the holy Scriptures. Not only is the complete and perfect plan of God’s redemption through His Son is written in the Bible. It also includes the condition of man along with his nature, desires, pursuits, and end.\n\nEverything that man needs to know with regards to his soul is in the Scriptures. Today, we will let the word of God bring us into a state of self-examination not for the purpose of bringing condemnation upon ourselves but to see what we really need. Only the word of God can expose us for who and what we truly are and God does this always for our good and ultimately for His own glory. May the Spirit of truth bring us face to face to the word of God and as we become exposed before God, may we be convicted to throw ourselves upon His mercy and grace.\n\n##### **All is Vanity**\n\nThe Scripture is filled with many truths which may appear untrue to the carnal mind. Even some believers are having a hard time believing what’s written there. Nevertheless, God’s word is true no matter what we feel, think, or believe. No matter how much we reason against God, the final verdict is from God and His verdict is that whatever is in His word, it is truth.\n\nOne of the most painful assertions in the Scriptures is written by the wisest man (aside from the Lord Jesus Christ) who ever walked on the face of the earth — King Solomon, the son of David with Bathsheba (2 Sam. 12:24). Under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, he wrote most of the book of Proverbs, Songs of Songs, and Ecclesiastes. Solomon was young when he became king and having understood his limitation that time, he asked the Lord that He would give him wisdom and He did.\n\nIn the Book of Ecclesiastes, King Solomon wrote:\n\n> “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher;\n> “Vanity of vanities,**all is vanity**.”\n> What profit has a man from all his labor\n> In which he toils under the sun?\n> **Ecclesiastes 1:2–3**\n\nIs everything really vain? Is there really no profit in everything that we do under sun? Of course not! All is vanity not in the sense that everything is futile or that everything that we do has no value. Not everything is worthless for there are things that have value — but only _temporal_ value. Your studies, jobs, businesses, and other endeavors have temporal value. These things are not worthless. In fact, God is glorified when you do these things for His glory. But if we are going to look to things through the lens of the spiritual, everything indeed is vanity. All is vanity because “That which has been is what will be, That which is done is what will be done, And there is nothing new under the sun (Ecclesiastes 1:9)”. Events are recurring. History is repeated. There is nothing new under the sun.\n\n##### **Look Behind**\n\nSolomon wrote,\n\n> Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them.\n> I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,\n> For my heart rejoiced in all my labor;\n> And this was my reward from all my labor.\n> **Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done**\n> And on the labor in which I had toiled;\n> And indeed all was vanity and grasping for the wind.\n> There was no profit under the sun.\n> **Ecclesiastes 2:10–11**\n\nOne definition of the word “vanity” is an _“excessive pride in or admiration of one’s own appearance or achievements”_. This is why for Solomon, all his labor was in vain. Not because his labor did not produce good results but because he took pride in all his labor. He said, “For my heart **_rejoiced in all my labor_**; And **_this was my reward_** from all my labor”. There is a form of joy that he got from what he accomplished and that became the reward or in other words, the satisfaction of his heart. But then, Solomon was really wise for when he looked back to all that his hands had made, he saw the emptiness, the void, the unprofitability, and the futility of it all and his conclusion was “indeed all was vanity and grasping for the wind.” All was vanity for Solomon because he made his labors the ultimate source of his joy and satisfaction. The mindset that what you do, that is, your performance will ever satisfy you is a symptom of a prideful heart. It is in essence thinking that what you do **MUST** be about you and ultimately **FOR** you. In short, that is self-dependence, self-trust, self-sufficiency, self-righteousness, and self-centeredness. And as long as we regard other things and even what we do and ourselves as the well from which our joy springs, all is vanity.\n\nThe wise king likened the vanity of everything to grasping the wind. Try to grasp the wind. Did you catch a portion of it? Did the wind stay in your hand? I am sure that it didn’t. And yet that’s what we do, right? We follow hard after the things of this world even though we already know that nothing in this world can satisfy our souls. God intended that the creation be for man’s enjoyment and supplication. The things which are external to man and even the things that man can produce are not intended to be the source of his joy and satisfaction. God literally walked with our first parents in the Garden of Eden and I must speculate that God was their joy and God was most glorified in them for they were most satisfied in Him. Until the Fall of man happened.\n\nOne of the results of man’s radical fallenness is that his disposition was changed from something that delights in God to something that is rebellious against Him. Man’s heart is no longer captivated by God’s glory. That’s why the Bible says, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)”. Man’s heart became so stone cold towards God but it desires sin and the poisonous effects that it brings. We lack the regard for God’s glory, that is what falling short of God’s glory means. Thus, although we knew God, we did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in our thoughts, and our foolish hearts were darkened (Rom. 1:21). Instead of pursuing the Creator, we pursued the things of the world. The external things which are not meant to satisfy our souls are now the things that enslave us and at the same time the things that we pursue.\n\nWe live in a time where there are lots of things around us that are designed in order to attempt to satisfy the needs of men. These things are being fed to us on a daily basis. In this world of self and instant gratification, we see the big role that the media plays. The media shows us what our flesh desires and creates in us a craving for more entertainment — a means which can never get through the depths of the heart. The social media is flooded with contents which aim to inspire, motivate, and push us to be better or to pursue self-advancement. While there is some good in that, we know for sure that such things can still leave us lifeless and unsatisfied. The default of men today is to turn to the world for satisfaction even though they know already that a vanity piled on top of another vanity will just end up in vanity.\n\nHaving known these things, let us go back to Solomon’s conclusion:\n\n> **Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done**\n> And on the labor in which I had toiled;\n> And indeed **all was vanity and grasping for the wind.**\n> There was no profit under the sun.\n> **Ecclesiastes 2:11**\n\nI want you to look back on the things that you’ve said and done in the past years, months, weeks, or even days. Now, can you honestly tell that most of your time were spent glorifying God, seeking Him, pursuing Him, following Him? When was the last time you drink a glass of water for His glory? When was the last time that you did not let a day skip without reading His word? When was the last time you slipped away from the noise of this world to get alone with God in worship and prayer? When was the last time that the Lord is the desire of your hearts? Were the things you said and done pleasing to God? Can you say that the way you lived your life prior to this day was worth it?\n\nThe Bible teaches us,\n\n> **Do not love the world or the things in the world**. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\n> For all that is in the world — the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life — is not of the Father but is of the world.\n> And **the world is passing away**, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.\n> **1 John 2:15–17**\n\nIf most of your answers to the diagnostic questions above are negative, then you really have to admit that God is no longer your joy. You have to humbly admit with all honesty that you need to repent and to turn to God. The Bible teaches that we should not love the world or the things of the world. We had once walked in the pattern of this world, we had once gratified ourselves with the pleasures of this world, we had once boast in ourselves and in what we did. Now it is time to abandon all those things because the world is passing away and everything in it. That is what Solomon is talking about — that the end of everything in this world is vanity.\n\nBut we have to admit that it is hard to let go of the things which we once held dear to us. We had attachments to the temporal and the material which made us detached from the spiritual, from the things of God and from God Himself. We had habits which don’t bring glory to God. We had sins that we love. We had become self-centered that we have forgotten that our lives should be about God and for God. But I truly believe that if we understand that Christ is the only one who is all-satisfying and that in Him is the fullness of joy, we will surely leave every vanity that is in the world.\n\n##### **Look to Christ: Joy in Christ and Christ as joy**\n\nYou see, no matter what things we make as our own means of finding joy — whether it is our hobbies, work, studies, endless TV series, gratification in social media, approval and appraise of men, and even relationships and our church ministries — we will never be joyful with joy that lasts. The reason for this is that it is only that in God’s presence the fullness of joy is found and satisfying pleasures are in Him alone (Psalm 16:11).\n\nWe express through our worship songs that the Lord is the fountain that won’t run dry. But when was the last time we come to Him for a drink of living water? What we always do is that we take the road back to Egypt and drink its bitter waters. We, as Christians, are not ignorant that God is there but we always exercise negligence of Him and in so doing we willfully forsake Him for the sake of the unprofitable things of the world. We love the bitter waters of the world which unknowingly poisons us and drains the life out of us. We forget that life is only found in the Lord and that anything outside of Jesus Christ is a total absurdity. We are not even ashamed that we no longer have the desire to “taste and see that the Lord is good (Psalm 34:8)”. When was the last time that we are one with the Psalmist when he said:\n\n> “As a deer pants for flowing streams,\n> so pants my soul for You, O God.\n> **My soul thirsts for God,\n> for the living God.**\n> When shall I come and appear before God?”\n> **Psalm 42:1–2**\n\nNow I am calling you to come to Jesus and see Him as the all-satisfying one, the never-ending joy for our hearts. The joy that is found in Him alone is the only joy that can make our hearts like a well-watered garden. Consider the Apostle Paul with his credentials:\n\n> If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so:\n> circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.\n> **Philippians 3:4–6**\n\nJust like Solomon, Paul had his labors. He once boasted what he was and his confidence in his flesh produced in him a false zeal that led to the persecution of many early believers. But for Paul, it wasn’t too late. He wrote to Timothy,\n\n> And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; **but I obtained mercy** because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.\n> **1 Timothy 1:12–13**\n\nPaul obtained mercy from God and He was saved by the grace of God. His encountered with Christ changed him in a dramatic way that he became passionate to spread the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Having known Christ and having saved by Him, this is his amazing resolve:\n\n> **But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ**.\n> Yet indeed** I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord**, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ\n> **Philippians 3:7–8**\n\nPaul was able to count all things as loss because he knew to whom he should be running. He knew what his life should be about. He knew that Christ is His ultimate gain. He knew that Christ alone can bring him satisfaction. When he encountered Christ, his confidence in himself was gone. His pride that once stood high was knocked down. His disposition was changed. When he met Christ in all of His beauty and glory, his emptiness surfaced and that made him want Christ more. Indeed, all things were vanity for Paul and he counted them as loss for the sake of having his all-satisfying Savior. For Paul, nothing is more supreme or excellent than the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. Indeed, he understood the true essence of eternal life — to know God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent (John 17:3).\n\nWe know that Christ important. But do we know that He is the most important? May our resolve be like that of the Apostle Paul’s. May Christ reign supreme in our heart so that we will no longer run after the things of this world. Life is in Christ alone and He Himself is the Life. Real and lasting joy is found in Him alone and only Him must be our satisfaction.\n\nNow, I am calling you not only to look behind you but more importantly to forget what is behind and to look forward to what lies ahead. Just like what Paul said,\n\n> Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, **forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead**,\n> **Philippians 3:13**\n\nYou cannot do anything about your past. The world will not change anytime soon. The evil and the vanity in this world will grow worse. But understand that we are pilgrims here. This world is not our home so let your eyes be stamped with eternity as you run this race:\n\n> …let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,** looking unto Jesus**, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n> **Hebrews 12:1–2**\n\nWhen being drawn into the world, when the world is trying to lure you into its vain pleasures, just remember that you are not of this world, you are already in Christ. Thus,\n\n> If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. For you died, **and your life is hidden with Christ in God.\n> Colossians 3:1–3**\n\nThe only life that is worth living is the life lived for Christ. In the world is vanity, but in Christ our end is glory.\n",

          "raw": "\nIt is common knowledge among Christians and even non-Christians that Jesus was raised from the dead. But for a believer, Christ's resurrection was not just a mere historical event -_ it is the believer's glorious assurance_.\n\nPaul the Apostle wrote in 1 Corinthians 15:\n\n> But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.\n> **1 Corinthians 15:20-22**\n\nHere's what the Lord led me to understand in the Spirit-inspired passages written by Apostle Paul:\n\n### 1. The Feast of Firstfruits points to Christ and His resurrection\n\nPaul wrote that Christ is God's righteousness that is witnessed or testified by the Law and the Prophets (Rom. 3:21). Our Lord Himself said that Moses wrote about Him (John 5:46) and that He came not to abolish the Law but to fulfill it (Matt. 5:17).\n\nOne of the feasts which He fulfilled, or more accurately, that points to Him and His resurrection is the Feast of Firstfruits. A firstfruit is a literal harvest and any harvest came or sprouted from the ground. In the case of Christ, He was buried and on the third day He rose again. In Leviticus, it is written:\n\n> He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted on your behalf; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.\n> **Leviticus 23:11**\n\nHow does that point to Christ? First, Christ the firstfruits (1 Cor. 15:23) rose after the Sabbath (Matt. 28:1), on the first day of the week (John 20:1). Secondly, while the literal firstfruits are to be accepted on behalf of the Israelites, God raised Christ from the dead to show that He vindicated or accepted His sacrifice and His resurrection is for the justification of God's people (Rom. 4:25).\n\n### 2. The Extent of Being Alive in Christ\n\nThrough Adam sin came into the world and through it death spread to all men (Rom. 5:12). Through Christ's obedience, many are justified and the gift of righteousness abounded to many (Rom. 5:16-17). Paul said,\n\n> For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness **will reign in life** through the One, Jesus Christ.)\n> **Romans 5:17**\n\nReigning in life is the extent of being made alive in Christ. But that reigning in life is not a life that is free of trouble, or having lots of temporal riches. It does not also mean that we will never die physically. The fullness of reigning in life is not for today but for the future when we'll finally receive our glorified body, when death will finally be swallowed. When there's no more death only we can reign in life through and with Christ. So, Christ's resurrection is not only for our justification and spiritual regeneration but it also assures us of our future glorification.\n\nSoli Deo Gloria!\n",

          "raw": "\nThe glory of God is the sum and the substance of all that He is. God is infinitely holy and He is utterly perfect. No one is more beautiful than Him given His grandeur and majesty. He reigns with utter sovereignty, absolute authority, and great power. He is dependent to none and yet all depends on Him. He is self-sufficient and in need of nothing. Truly, He is the glorious God.\n\nThe Scripture teaches that the heavens declare the glory of God (Psa. 19:1). All of creation is all about showcasing God’s glory. From the most minute of subatomic particle to celestial bodies such as the stars, all show His manifold attributes. The Scripture also tells us that man was created in the image of God, according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26). Now, the purpose why God created man is also for His own glory. He said,\n\n> Everyone who is called by My name,\n> Whom I have created for My glory;\n> I have formed him, yes, I have made him.”\n> **-Isaiah 43:7**\n\nThe first question in the Westminster Catechism goes like this, _“What is the chief end of man?”_ and the answer is this,_ “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.”_. Yes, that’s why we exist. Our life is never about us so it must not revolved around us. In fact, it is written that,\n\n> …whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God\n> **-1 Corinthians 10:31**\n\nGod displays His glory through the creation and He created us for His own glory. The point is that our lives should be about glorifying Him by enjoying Him forever. However, is that what we see today?\n\n#### **The Fall: Falling Short of God’s Glory**\n\nIt has been widely known among Christians the verse which says, “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)”. But do we really know what it means? What does “have sinned” mean? What does falling short of God’s glory mean? We’ll answer that as we consider the following account of the Fall of man in the Garden of Eden.\n\n> So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.\n> **-Genesis 3:6**\n\nThe Garden of Eden was where God put our first parents, Adam and Eve. There they walked with God and they could freely talk to Him. No chasm was there to divide them. The access to the divine presence was wide open and free. Nothing hindered them from enjoying God. But all of that were only a reality until Eve “saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise”. Being influenced by the serpent’s deception, the created tree of which the fruit was forbidden to be eaten was found good, pleasant, and desirable by Eve. This led her into eating its fruit and then she gave it to her husband Adam and it was at that moment that “through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men (Romans 5:12)”.\n\nIn that narrative we see what it means to fall short of God’s glory. Eve and Adam fell short of God’s glory when they saw that the fruit of the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil was good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and desirable. It was as though God was not enough for them anymore. So they esteemed with higher regard than the glory of God the fruit of the created tree. That shifted desire from a desire for the Creator to the desire for the creation became the framework in which man’s inclination is based. Every man is so radically depraved to the degree that he exchanged the glory of God for a created thing (Romans 1:23). Man’s affections are naturally towards the anything less than God. The creation which is meant to be external to us is now man’s pursuit. Man’s life which is ought to be lived for God’s glory is now being lived wastefully for himself. Oh, what a depraved being we are apart from God’s grace!\n\n#### **The Extent of “Have Sinned”**\n\nMan’s sinfulness goes beyond his actions. Man is a sinner not only because he commits sin but also, or more accurately, that he commits sin because he is a sinner. So man’s sinfulness is not just an issue of behavior, it is an issue of nature. Sin is a nature. It is like a prison. Man follows it and this makes him a “slave of sin (Rom. 6:16,17)” and at the same time it is his pursuit: “we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind (Ephesians 2:3)”.\n\nSin brought spiritual deadness in us. For that reason, we cannot savor the glory of God. We cannot respond to His beauty. We are blinded by sin that we cannot see His infinite worth. Our hearts became a factory of many idols that we cannot regard Him as a precious treasure. We cannot because we will not. It’s not only about having an inability to see Him but it’s really about our lack of willingness to see Him and our lack of desire for Him. Our Lord Jesus Christ testified of this when He said:\n\n> And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and **men loved darkness rather than light**, because their deeds were evil.\n> **-John 3:19**\n\nSo, the light is there but men won’t come for their desire is darkness. Men “loved” darkness rather than the light. So men run to darkness not because there is no light but because they are inclined to it deep within their heart. Now, given our natural condition, how can we regard God again with the highest esteem? How can our enjoyment of Him be restored? How can the divine glory which was trampled and exchanged for lesser things become the most precious treasure of our heart?\n\n#### **Savoring God through Christ**\n\nJesus Christ is the Son of God. He is the image of the invisible God, the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person (Col. 1:15, Heb. 1:3). He is the Word from the beginning and the Word who became flesh (John 1:1, 14a). The Apostle John testified:\n\n> we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\n> **-John 1:14**\n\nJohn later tells us,\n\n> No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.\n> **-John 1:18**\n\nThe point of all that is that Christ is the greatest revelation of God. In Christ, God is revealed. From His birth, in His life, in His ministry, at the cross, in His resurrection to His ascension, God is revealed.\nThe coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is pivotal not only to history but more importantly to the life of a sinful man. The word of God tells us that Jesus was born “for He will save His people from their sins (Matt. 1:21)”. That promise is not only about saving us from the consequences of sins such as God’s wrath, death, and eternal damnation. In that salvation our spiritual regeneration is included. It was said by the LORD Himself,\n\n> Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean;\n> I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols.\n> I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you;\n> I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.\n> I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes,\n> and you will keep My judgments and do them.\n> **-Ezekiel 36:25–27**\n\nThat is the gospel in summary. That promise includes our cleansing and the giving of a new heart to us. That new heart is no longer a heart of stone which is cold towards God. That new heart is a heart the delights in God.\n\nThrough the preaching of the gospel, the person and works of Christ is proclaimed to the unregenerate. By that, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God is given in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 4:6). Thus, if we want to truly behold God in His glory, we have to fix our gaze upon Christ. We have to look to Him continually. “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18)”.\n\nWhen the Lord Jesus said that He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, what He is essentially saying is that He is the Way not only to be with the Father but also the Way to know the Father. He is the Truth through whom we can know all about God. He is the Life who gives us life eternal that we may enjoy God now and for all eternity.\n\nThe Apostle Paul wrote,\n\n> For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.\n> **And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ**, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.\n> **-Romans 5:10–11**\n\nThe reality that we are saved from God’s wrath and that we have now peace with God is indeed worthy to be celebrated. But Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, reminds us that our reconciliation with God through Christ is a cause of rejoicing. He is us that it is only through Christ that we can truly rejoice in God.\n\nSo then, in order to be able to return to God and to savor His glory again, we need Christ. Our original purpose which was marred by sin is restored through Christ. Through Christ we can now rejoice in God. We can now be one with the Psalmist when he said,\n\n> My flesh and my heart fail;\n> But God is the strength of my heart **and my portion foreve**r.\n> **-Psalms 73:26**\n\nWe can now say with confidence that the Lord is our portion forever, meaning that He is all that we have and therefore He is the very Treasure of our hearts. True and lasting joy is in His presence alone as well as the good and satisfying pleasures (Psa. 16:11). And thanks be to God for in blessing us with “every spiritual blessing”, He bestows upon us this great privilege of glorifying Him by enjoying Him forever through our beautiful Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. And this is how we return to God’s glory.\n\n-jep\n",

          "raw": "\n> But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace…\n> **(Ephesians 2:13–14)**\n\nThe believer’s walk is marked with constant collision with the flesh, the world, and the devil. We still live in a fallen world with its fallen system around us. For this reason, we find ourselves oftentimes distracted, confused, and defeated. Eventually, our joy ceases to manifest. We become numb to the degree that we no longer desire the things of God and yet we take pleasures from the things of the world. Our appetite for the sweetness of Christ grows weaker and our affections for the bitter waters of the world become stronger.\n\nWe may constrain ourselves to the commands of Scriptures. We may subject our bodies to godly discipline. We may read how-to books and follow them. But when all is said and done, if it is not the proper fuel when it comes to walking with God, we’ll just end up burnt-out and joyless. As a Christian, we need a better prime mover by which we can be compelled to _“present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service (Romans 12:1)._”\n\nWhat must be the Christian’s constant fuel to be able to enjoy his walk with Christ? David had a prayer written in Psalm 51:12:\n\n> Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,\n> And uphold me by Your generous Spirit.\n> **(Psalms 51:12)**\n\nA deeper appreciation of Christ will grow in us if we are always reminded of the salvation that God has wrought in us through Him. The joy that salvation produces is always there. The problem is man’s appreciation of it becomes lesser as he indulges himself to the things of the world that is why he loses his joy. This is why David said, “_restore **TO ME** the joy of Your salvation_”. Like David, we can only be truly joyful if we are constantly amazed by God’s work of salvation as revealed in the gospel. Ask yourself the question,\n\n> When was the last time that I stand amazed in the grace of God?\n\nIn this post, we will have a closer look to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I trust that the Spirit of God will shine upon our hearts the light of the gospel and will restore to us the joy of God’s salvation. May the Spirit create in us a special love for Christ and His word as we get a deeper understanding of the gospel.\n\n##### **The Gospel is the Gospel of Peace because we were once God’s Enemies.**\n\n> Therefore, remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh — who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands — that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.\n> **(Ephesians 2:11–13)**\n\nPaul told the churches in Ephesus to remember their past state. It may sound off if you are used to hearing expressions such as “don’t think negatively”, “you attract what you think”. When Paul told them to remember who they were, he is essentially telling them to remember their sinful state and what they lack apart from Christ. It is not a call to think negatively or to be sin-conscious. We remember who we were not to condemn ourselves but to appreciate more the glory of the gospel. As the stars shine the brightest on a pitch-black canvas of the night sky, so is the gospel shines the most at the recognition of our past sinful state.\n\nNow, Paul listed what the Ephesians lacked apart from Christ:\n\n- Without Christ;\n- Aliens (foreigners) from the commonwealth of Israel;\n- Strangers from the covenants of promise;\n- Having no hope; and\n- Without God in the world.\n\nGod is the God of Israel. The ethnic Israel is the object upon which God bestows His blessings. They are His chosen nation (Deut. 14:2) and for this reason to them _“pertain the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises (Romans 9:4)”_. Such blessings were not originally given to the Gentiles (other nations). Now, we are Gentiles as well. In the past, we were without Christ and the ultimate effect of this is being without God in the world.\n\nEssentially, without Christ we have no reconciliation with God. In other words, we have no peace with Him. Having no peace with God means we were His enemies. Why is that? We have to go back to what the essence of sin is. To sin is to _“fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)”_ which means to not glorify Him. We have to remember that sinning is more than just committing a silly mistake. It is a willful rebellion against God. Whenever we sin, we are committing a cosmic treason, a rebellion against the Divine. For this reason, our being becomes sinful in nature. We are sinners not because we sin, we sin because we are sinners. Because of our sinfulness we _“were by nature children of wrath, just as the others (Eph. 2:3)”_. We were once an object of God’s wrath and God is wrathful towards His enemies. This is the bad news that only the gospel can solve.\n\n##### **The Gospel is the Gospel of Peace because Christ Himself is our Peace.**\n\nAfter telling the Ephesians to remember their past state, Paul goes on and makes an important transition:\n\n> **But** now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.\n> **(Ephesians 2:13)**\n\nJust like the Ephesians, we were once far off not only because we are not a part of Israel but because we were literally without Christ and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, we have been brought near by the blood of Christ. Remember that the problem is being separated from God so the solution must be a reconciliation.\n\nThe gospel message tells us that we have been brought near by the blood of Christ. That’s the good news there! It is not our own blood that was shed to atone for our sins. It is the precious blood of the Lamb of God that was shed on the cross for the remission of our sins. We know for sure that the blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9), but we have to be reminded that His blood also made us reconciled to God, thus making peace with Him.\n\n> For **He Himself [Christ] is our peace**, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation,\n> **(Ephesians 2:14)**\n\nChrist Himself is our peace with God by His blood. How does it happen? At the cross, Jesus became guilty by imputation. The Prophet Isaiah wrote,\n\n> And the LORD has laid on Him [Christ] the iniquity of us all.\n> **(Isaiah 53:6)**\n\nJesus knew no sin and He has no sin of His own (2 Cor. 5:21) but because our sins were laid or imputed on Him, He became guilty by imputation. In fact, the Father Himself “made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21)”. Christ became sin for us and for this reason He became the object of God’s wrath. We have to remember that God is not only love, He is also just. His justice demands that the guilty be punished that is why the punishment that we deserve fell upon Christ. Christ became the propitiation, that is, a sacrifice that removes wrath. The Father’s wrath was completely satisfied through the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is how He reconciled the sinners to the Holy God thus making peace with Him. Isaiah wrote,\n\n> The chastisement for our peace was upon Him,\n> **(Isaiah 53:5)**\n\nMan can never be right or be at peace with God by his own works. It takes the sacrifice of the sinless, perfect Son of God to reconcile man to God. We can conclude now:\n\n> Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ…**(Romans 5:1)**\n\n##### **The Gospel of Peace produces double reconciliation**\n\n###### **1. Jews and Gentiles reconciled with one another**\n\n> For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace,\n> **(Ephesians 2:14–15)**\n\nRemember that the Gentiles are not part of Israel and thus have no part in the blessings which are for Israel. But Jesus made both (Jews & Gentiles) one by breaking down the middle wall of separation. Now, therefore, the Gentiles are “no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God (Ephesians 2:19)”. We are now one new man in Christ. We are the new creation in Christ.\n\n> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.\n> **(2 Corinthians 5:17)**\n\n###### **2. Jews & Gentiles both reconciled to God**\n\n> …and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.\n> **(Ephesians 2:16–18)**\n\nThe means of God to reconcile us to Himself is the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ. The cross is where the Lord atoned for the sins of many, absorbing God’s wrath thus satisfying His justice. Now, peace is being proclaimed to those who were afar off (Gentiles) and to those who are near (Jews). As the new creation in Christ, we now have access by the Spirit of God to the Father.\n\nThe greatest problem of man is not his empty bank account, not his failing body, not his relationships, not his lack of job, and not his slow temporal success. Such things will be addressed by God if and only if He wills it. But the greatest problem of man is being without Christ and without God in the world or in other words, having no peace with God. The gospel is the only message that tells men how to be reconciled to God.\n\nThe gospel of peace produces joy and comfort in the heart of the believer. Joy, because being reconciled to God, knowing that we were once His enemies, is the ultimate gift one can have. This is also our motivation to know Christ more — His person and His works. The gospel drives us to love Him and His words. The gospel compels us to joyfully pursue Him and to desire Him above all else. The joy that we have from Him enables us to easily abandon all the pleasures in the world. Comfort, because though we are Christians and under the covenant of God’s grace, we are not exempted from this life’s struggles and problems. In fact, Jesus said that in this world we will have tribulation (John 16:33). But the gospel of peace brings comfort in our hearts and reminds us that we are pilgrims in this world and we ought to have our eyes be stamped with eternity so that we will constantly hold on to the hope that is in Christ — the hope that one day we will finally be with God in heaven.\n",

          "raw": "\n> Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed,\n> Because His compassions fail not.\n> — LAMENTATIONS 3:22\n\nGod is divine being. His being is absolute which means that what and who He is never depends on anything outside of Him. There is no standard for His being, He Himself is the standard. It is for this reason that God is indeed incomparable, that He is the LORD and besides Him, there is no other (Isa. 45:5). God is perfect and His attributes tell us of His glory, that is, the sum and the substance of all that He is. His attributes tell us how weighty He is.\n\nThe perfection of God is made known to man by the revelation of His attributes. There is a general revelation of God in which He reveals Himself to all by the creation which He made. “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse (Rom. 1:20)”. Furthermore, “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork (Psa. 19:1)”. Therefore, man is without excuse. Man knows God at least in the cognitive sense and it is confirmed by what he sees and by his conscience.\n\nThere are also instances in which God reveals Himself by bestowing upon man His goodness, mercy, grace, forbearance, wrath, justice, and righteousness. Every single attribute of God that is revealed to us gives us a glimpse of His infinite worth and there is no other place where we can know Him other than His word. A thorough survey of the Scriptures makes us see that God is merciful, gracious, and at the same time He does judgments as an exercise of His justice. As we go along, we’ll see how these attributes differ and what the Bibles says about God’s mercy for the sinner.\n\n##### **MERCY, GRACE, AND JUSTICE**\n\nBefore diving into the mercy of God for a sinner, it is first important for us to understand the distinction between mercy, grace, and justice. Oftentimes mercy is confused with grace and the way God shows mercy is oftentimes mistaken as an act of injustice. So how do these attributes of God differ from one another?\n\nThe justice of God is that which God bestows on sinners for they deserve it. All men sinned and the justice of God demands that the guilty be punished (Exo. 34:7). Men deserve the punishment of death and God is just if He will exercise judgment on the rebellious. The grace of God is that which God gives to the sinner even though they do not deserve it. One example of God showing His grace is when He justified us. The Bible teaches that we are justified freely by His grace (Rom. 3:24). The word “free” then must come to our mind when we hear about God’s grace. Grace is not attained nor achieved; it is only freely given. Now, God shows mercy when He chooses to not give or bestow to sinners that which they deserve. As we go on, we will see why it is not injustice and what the Scriptures teaches about the mercy of God for a sinner.\n\n##### **THE MERCY OF GOD FOR A SINNER**\n\nThe Prophet Jeremiah, under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, wrote: “Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed; Because His compassions fail not (Lam. 3:22)”. Now, don’t we deserve to be consumed, that is, to become undone and die? We do, absolutely! Death is what a sinner deserves. But based on our text, we are not consumed and that means what we deserve didn’t fall upon us. The reason for this is the mercy of God for the sinner. “Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed” — God can choose to deal with the sinner according to His mercies. A similar passage can be found in the New Testament: “But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (Eph. 2:4–5)”. The statement “even when we were dead in trespasses” implies that there is something we deserve for being dead in trespasses (slave to sin, sinful) and that is death, that is us being consumed. But through the richness of His mercy, we have been made alive in Christ which means “we are not consumed”.\n\n##### **THE MERCY AND LOVE OF GOD**\n\nNow we’ll see why in showing mercy God is not unjust. When God deals with a sinner according to His mercy, His motivation is His love. Going back to our key text, “Through the LORD’s mercies we are not consumed, Because His compassions fail not (Lam. 3:22).” God’s compassion is His passionate love for the sinner. God’s love is Himself willing to show His goodness to the sinner. This compassion of God does not fail. Again, in the similar passage in Ephesians we read, “But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us… (Eph. 2:4)”. There is a divine great love with which God loves the sinner that He is willing to show the sinner the richness of His mercy. David knows this that’s why in one of his gut-wrenching psalms he wrote: “Have mercy upon me, O God; According to Your lovingkindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. (Psa. 51:1)”. What David was pleading was that God would deal with Him according to His love and mercy and not to give him the punishment he deserved. Therefore, when God shows His mercy, He is not doing something that is unjust. What He is actually showing is who He is, being merciful and loving. The mercy of God is not in conflict with His justice. God’s justice, as portrayed in the Scriptures, is always accompanied by His wrath while God’s mercy, as we have already seen, is accompanied by God’s unfailing compassion or great love.\n\n##### **THE SINNER’S CRY FOR MERCY**\n\nThose who truly cry for God’s mercy are those who genuinely came to the understanding of their sinfulness and the just punishment that they deserve. God shows His mercy to the helpless — those who can’t find any hope in themselves. David, in his brokenness, wrote, “Have mercy upon me, O God; According to Your lovingkindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. (Psa. 51:1)”. The tax collector was in absolute despair when he uttered, “God, be merciful to me, a sinner! (Luke 18:13)”. Paul also obtained mercy even though he persecuted the church of God. He wrote, “although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy (1 Tim. 1:12–13)”. These men, among many others, were honest before God. They admitted before Him that they were helpless and that they knew that their only hope is God dealing with them according to His tender mercies and steadfast love. Therefore, the understanding of our sinfulness and that we deserve a punishment far worse than physical death is a gift. It is a wonderful understanding indeed for it makes us run to God to cast ourselves upon His mercies.\n\n_All Scripture quotations are in NKJV._\n",

          "raw": "\nHave you ever wondered why the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ was necessary? If you have ever pondered on that question, I am sure that you’ve been left with a satisfied and amazed heart. At the same time, you probably felt so much humbled as you realized the sinfulness of sin, the just and holy character of God, and the weight of Christ’s atoning work at the cross.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to seek and save the lost (Luke 19:10). However, finding His own is not enough to reconcile them to the Father. This is because God is just and to just simply pardon a sinner without paying the debt that is due to his sins is not a character of a just and holy God. The justice of God requires the condemnation of any one who has sinned against Him. For this reason, we are helpless to save ourselves for all of us have sinned (Romans 3:23). So, one answer to the question of why the atonement is necessary is this: the just and holy character of God. While that answer is about who God is, the second answer is about who we are.\n\n##### **The Sinfulness of Sin**\n\nThe soul who sins shall die (Ezek. 18:4,20). The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23a). All have sinned and have fallen short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23). These horrifying effects of sin tell us that great is its sinfulness. Now, how deep or great do you think is the sinfulness of sin?\n\nSin is so serious because it is committed against the Holy God who is infinitely righteous, whose being is so perfect, whose character is so pure, quite incomprehensible to the human mind. Thus, the punishment to the one who sins against God must be so severe for God is absolutely holy. Since God is just, He will not only punish the sinners, but more importantly He MUST punish them.\n\nTo further understand this, let’s see as taught by the sacred Scriptures, the different ways by which the biblical authors describe sin:\n\n- **Debt**\n\nWhen we sin, we become indebted to God and this debt, we can never pay. We don’t have the ability to pay this debt for to sin is to become morally indebted to God. There isn’t someone among the sinful men from whom we can borrow or get the payment for this debt.\nWhen the Lord Jesus taught the model prayer in Matthew 6, He said this:\n\n> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\n> **(Matthew 6:12)**\n\nThe Lord didn’t mean that we have a monetary debt to God. What’s that about is asking God for forgiveness for our sins. So to sin is to be a debtor to God.\n\n- **Enmity**\n\nEnmity means war. It also refers to hostility or having an ill will or bitter grudge against the opposite party. Now, man in his sinful state is in enmity against God. The Bible teaches this:\n\n> Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be.\n> **(Romans 8:7)**\n\nMan’s desire for sin and his lack of regard for God’s glory is an indication that he doesn’t want God in his mind. Man’s hatred for God leads him to all kinds of excuses to the degree that he denies His existence. This is why there are atheists today who deny the obvious existence of God. They’re not actually atheist for there’s no such person as an atheist. What we have now in the world are liars who just deny what is obvious.\n\n- **Crime**\n\nThe late Dr. R.C. Sproul said, _“Sin is cosmic treason.”_.\n\nThat is absolutely right. Sin is committed against the Holy King, the One who sits on the throne, far above the heavens, seated with authority and reigning in sovereignty. Sin is a heinous crime against the Divine and thus deserving of great punishment. God gave man a command and He plainly told him not to cross a certain line. But man did. Man fell into sin by an act of disobedience and a disobedience of God’s command is sin. Man isn’t entitled to commit one sin. One sin is enough to send him to hell forever. The Bible teaches this:\n\n> Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\n> **(1 John 3:4)**\n\nGod drew the line but we crossed it. God said, “Thou shall not” and we said back to Him, “I will”. He said, “Thou shall” and we willfully rebelled against Him by saying, “I will not”. This is man’s natural inclination. We are naturally law breakers.\n\nThis is the sinfulness of sin. This is the other reason why the atoning work of Christ is indeed necessary. An understanding of what the Bible teaches about sin and the humble, genuine acceptance that we are sinners will surely compel us to cast ourselves upon God’s mercy. Now, God being rich in mercy, didn’t leave us helpless. He provided a way for us to be saved  **_the atonement_** .\n\n##### **The Atonement**\n\nSo now, a question should arise in our minds : “Since God is just and holy and that it is rightful for Him to punish the guilty, how can He forgive sinners?”\n\nThat is a valid and an important question to ask. That’s what theologians call the Divine Dilemma. But the answer is found in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nYou see, Christ came to save sinners from their sins. Even His name “Jesus” literally means “to save” or “savior”. Among the many things which He completely and perfectly did, here are some of them:\n\n- **Forgiveness**\n\nWhile to sin is to become a debtor to God, to be in Christ is to be forgiven of sins. The one who sins shall die for the wages of sin is death. But Christ bore the sins of many and His blood was shed in order for them to be forgiven.\n\n> In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace…\n> **(Ephesians 1:7)**\n\nChrist satisfied the justice and appeased the wrath of God by becoming the propitiation or the sacrifice that removes wrath on our behalf. Christ paid the debt that we could never pay through the shedding of His own precious blood at the cross. God Himself put Christ forward to be the substitute for us (Rom. 3:25).\n\n- **Peace and Reconciliation**\n\nWhile to sin is to be in enmity against God, or to be estranged from Him, to be in Christ is to be reconciled to the Father.\n\n> But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation\n> **(Ephesians 2:13-14)**\n\nOur sins have separated us from God, “But your iniquities have separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from you, So that He will not hear (Isa. 59:2)”. But Christ’s work at the cross which justly removed the wrath of God towards His people made us reconciled to Him. When a person gets born again, he effectively becomes at peace with God. The great divide is no more and the saved can now enjoy God’s presence. This is then the start of the lifelong and eternal enjoyment in and with God as the newly converted regards Him as the ultimate treasure of his heart and the never-ending river and the never-drying well of joy and satisfaction.\n\n- **Ransom**\n\nWhile sin is a crime against God, Christ paid the ransom that is due to our crime. The Lord Himself said,\n\n> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.\n> Mark 10:45\n\nAnd that’s exactly what He did. As the Good Shepherd, He laid down His own life as a ransom for many — the many who are sinful. His blood was the payment, His life was the cost. Rebels like us can now live in life and freedom because the Son of God died at that lonely cross, taking all our sins upon Him, and willfully paying the penalty that is due to such sins. Oh what a love!\n\nHere we see love — that Christ was willing to do what’s necessary in order to save sinful men. While the cross shows us the unimaginable horrors of sin and the wrath of God, we also see there the demonstration of God’s love with which He loved the ungodly (Rom. 5:8). Oh! What a beautiful truth indeed!\n\nSo why was the atonement necessary?\n\nGod is holy and just and we’re not. As sinners we are debtors, in enmity with God, and criminals before God. But Christ’s substitutionary atonement at the cross made the forgiveness of our sins possible, provided a way for us to be reconciled to the holy God having all charges against us completely dismissed, and paid the ransom that is due to our sins. By His atoning work at the cross, God’s justice was satisfied and His wrath was appeased. His love was demonstrated and the sinners are rescued and His Name is now and forever glorified! ☺\n\nOne final note, when you think about the cross, think of the vertical part of it as what Christ has done for the Father — satisfying His justice, absorbing His wrath, paying our debts by His blood and the horizontal part of it as the effects of His perfect work — debts forgiven, sinners reconciled, ransom paid.\n\nAlways remember that! ☺\n",

          "raw": "\nThe one thing that most people want other people to see is the thing that is most valuable to them. The one that we value the most is that which is most precious to us. It is the treasure of our hearts, our ultimate desire. This is what makes us excited for almost every day. This is what people believe in.\n\nLook at social media. People display priceless moments depicted in lovely photos. People share heartfelt memories. People showcase their business and the products that they sell. People share amazing stories about the goodness in humanity. People post their ideologies, point of views, perspectives and other things which are meaningful and indeed valuable to them. The soon-to-be-married couple parade their prenuptial photos and videos while the newly weds flaunt their sweet moments in their graceful wedding attires along with their ever supportive friends and relatives. Group of friends always boast their fun escapades and refreshing adventures. People also engage in debates and forums to defend what they believe in.\n\nWe have seen now that people have this natural desire to unveil before others what they are fond of the most, what they treasure, and what they believe in. However I can’t help but notice that there is a group of people who is so silent about the very thing that they profess is the most valuable to them — the Christians.\n\nChristians know and hold the very truth in which their salvation from sin is founded. To them was given the revelation about the predetermined plan of salvation from sins. To them was unveiled the very person of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. To them was granted the forgiveness of multitudes of sins. To them was imputed the righteousness of Christ for free — it is free for them while the Lord Jesus Christ suffered for it. They know the most valuable thing on the face of the earth and that is to know the Lord and to follow Him. They know that the only way to the Father is Christ and no religion can provide people salvation. They know the Only Truth that can truly set free a man from all bondages. They know the Author of Life who’s the Only One who can give a man eternal life. They know it all.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ was witnessed by the early Apostles. They had seen and heard Him firsthand. They were witnesses of His death, burial, resurrection and ascension. That’s why after the Holy Spirit had been given to them as written in the Book of Acts, they were so bold in proclaiming that Jesus is Lord and that there is no other name under heaven by which a man can be saved (Acts 4:12). They even had threats from the chief priests and Jewish rulers back then but they were so eager to preach Christ crucified. The Apostle Peter said, “for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard. (Acts 4:20).\" That was the deep desire which consumed them all and compelled them to spread the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ — crying out to the people, on a daily basis, that they should repent, turn from their sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. This is indeed the most important for the early disciples of Christ so they poured out their all to the gospel, to continue in faith no matter what persecutions they might face. This is what drives them. In their hearts, there was always this urgency to go from town to town just to tell all kinds of people the truth!\n\nIs that what the Christians nowadays do and cry out on a daily basis? No! What I see are Christians who are more excited for the latest movies and TV series out there. What I see are Christians who say they believe but denying the power of what they believe in their lives. What I see are Christians who worship with their lips but having a heart that’s far from God. What I see are Christians who are passionate for their businesses or work or studies but have no desire for the word of God. What I see are Christians who wear Christian TShirts thinking that doing so makes them a real one. If Christians believe that the most valuable to have and know is Jesus Christ, shouldn’t they be out there shouting from the house tops this very thing? If they know that the world is getting messier and people are hopeless, shouldn’t they be out there proclaiming that God is a Father to the orphan, the help for the widow, the Provider for the poor, the Hope to the hopeless, the Light in the darkness and the only salvation from sins? I mean, if you know that someone is about to be hit by a big truck, will you just stand and stare or will you come running towards that person and tackle him in order to save him? Many Christians are just professing, they don’t really value what they believe in or should I say do they really believe? Many genuine Christians are dying on a daily basis in many nations because they confessed with boldness that Jesus is Lord in the midst of threats and persecutions. They persevere even they don’t have food and are in jail. Some are even hiding underground. Some don’t have a complete copy of the Bible. Whereas here in my nation where everyone is free to speak out what they believe in and where technology is very much accessible, Christians are still silent.\n\nWhat we believe can be contagious. But how can a fire become a wildfire if it’s not accompanied by heavy rushing wind? The same is true with the Christians. How can the Gospel be proclaimed if the appointed messengers are sleeping? The Apostle Paul got it right\n\n> **Romans 10:13-14**\n> For \"everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?For \"everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?\n\nChristians, stop being a sleeper. Abandon your excuses and live out your holy calling. To you have been entrusted the ministry of reconciliation. You are called an ambassador of Christ. You are not of the world so please stop loving the things in the world that God absolutely despises. You are sent into the world to go to the lost and to tell them the truth. Don’t receive the grace of God in vain. The truth of the gospel is so precious just to be kept in your closet. The world cannot know hope if you won’t speak. Preach the word my Christian friends, preach the word. Preach the word.\n",
